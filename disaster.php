  <div class="menu-content Disaster"><h1>Disasters</h1><hr>
<p>A disaster is a sudden, calamitOus event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or society and causes human, material, and economic or environmental losses that . exceed the community&#39;s or society&#39;s ability to cope using its - own resources. Though often caused by nature, disasters can &bull; have human origins.</p>
<p>A disaster occurs when a hazard impact&#39;s on vulnerable people. Hazards are threatening event, or probability of occurrence of a potentially damaging phenomenon within a given time period and area. The combination of hazards, vulnerability and inability to reduce the potential negative consequences of risk results in disaster. Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster. hits.</p>
<p><br></p></div>
  <div class="menu-content Between"><h1>Difference between Hazard and Disaster</h1><hr>
<p>&bull; Hazards and disasters are closely related and are sometimes used as synonymous to each other. Hazard is a .threat, while disaster is an event. The latter is a calamity or tragedy or a consequence of a hazard. Natural hazards that cause great loss to human life and economy are known as disasters and catastrophes. The term, &#39;disaster&#39; is sometimes also used to describe a &quot;catastrophic situation in which the normal patterns of life (or ecosystems) have been disrupted and extraordinary emergency interventions are required to save and preserve human lives and/or the environment.&quot;</p>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content Types"><<h1>Types of Hazards</h1>
<hr>
<p>Types of Hazards depending upon their. causes ,Hazards could be caused by nature or man and are consequently called natural and man-made hazards.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Hazards</strong></p>
<p>These are caused by the forces of nature and man has no role to play in such hazards. They are naturally occurring physical phenomena caused either by rapid or slow onset events which can be geophysical (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis and volcanic activity), hydrological (avalanches and floods), climatological (extreme temperatures, drought and . wildfires), meteorological (cyclones and storms/wave surges) or biological (disease epidemics and insect/animal plagues).</p>
<p><strong>Man-made Hazards</strong></p>
<p>Technological or man-made hazards (complex emergencies/conflicts, famine, displaced populations, industrial accidents and transport accidents) are events that are caused by humans and occur in or close to human settlements. This can include environmental degradation, pollution and accidents. Technological or man-made hazards (complex emergencies/conflicts, famine, displaced populations, industrial accidents and transport accidents).</p>
<p><strong>Socio-natural Hazards</strong></p>
<p>These are caused by the combined effect of natural forces and misdeeds of man. For example, the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts may increase due to indiscriininate felling of trees, particularly in the catchment areas of the rivers. Storm surge&#39;hazards may be Worsened by the destruction of mangroves. Although landslides Are normally caused by natural forces, yet they may be caused and their frequency and impact may be aggravated as a result of building roads in mountainous areas, excavating tunnels and by mining and quarrying.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>Hazards and disasters are unevenly distributed with respect to time and space. The terms likeearthquake prone&#39;, &#39;drought prone&#39; or &#39;flood prone&#39; areas are used to describe the distributional effect of the concerned hazards*.</p>
<p>People living in such areas are vulnerable to hazards and disaster of varied types. Thus, vulnerability is the extent to Which an individual or a community or an area is exposed to the impact of a hazard. The concept of vulnerability therefore implies a measure of risk combined with the level or social and economic ability to cope with the resulting event in Order to resist major disruption or loss.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Sendai">
<h1>Sendai Framework</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Sendai Framework is a 15-year, voluntary, non-binding agreement which recognises that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with otlier stakeholders including local government, the private sector and other stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>The Seven Global Targets</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per !COMO global mortality rate in the decade 2020-2030 compared to the period 2005-2015.</li>
    <li>Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower average global figure per 100,000 in the decade 209.0-2030 compared to the period 2005-2015.</li>
    <li>Reduce direct disaster &#39;economic loss in relation to global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030.</li>
    <li>Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, among them health and educational facilities, including through developing their resilience by 2030.</li>
    <li>Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020.</li>
    <li>Substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through adequate and sustainable support to complement their national actions for implementation of this Framework by 2030. Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to the people by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Four Priorities for Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>Priority 1. Understanding disaster risk</strong></p>
<p>Disaster risk management should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 2. Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk</strong></p>
<p>Disaster risk governance at the national, regional and global levels is very important for prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery and rehabilitation. It fosters Collaboration and partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Priority 3. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience</strong></p>
<p>Public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential to enhance the economic, social, health and cultural resilience of persons, communities, countries and their assets, as well as the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 4. Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to &quot;Build Back Better&quot; in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction</strong></p>
<p>The growth of disaster risk means there is a need to strengthen disaster preparedness for response, take action in anticipation of events, and ensure capacities are in place for effective response and recovery at all levels. The recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase is a critical opportunity to build back better, including through integrating disaster risk reduction into developinent creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Post Sendai Initiatives and Way Forward .</strong></p>
<p>March 18, 2015 was a historical day as it witnessed adoption of a 15-year plan by 188 UN Member Nations, including India. The plan termed as Sendai Framework&#39; was adopted during the 3rd UN World Conference on disaster risk reduction, held in the Japanese city of Sendai in 2015. The expected outcome of the framework is to prevent creation of new disaster risks and also to substantially reduce disaster risks. The four priority areas of Sendai Framework include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding Risk;</li>
    <li>Strengthening Risk Governance;</li>
    <li>Investing in disaster resilience; and</li>
    <li>Improving capacities for disaster response as well as for building back better after disasters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sendai Framework has set targets for substantial reduction in losses including reduction in number of deaths from disasters, number of people affected by disasters, economic losses and infrastructure losses. The new Framework calls for concrete indicators of progress towards these targets to be measured against the disaster losses in the decade after the adoption of the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), its predecessor.</p>
<p>In furtherance to its commitment to the Sendai framework, Government has taken up several important initiatives post Sendai Declaration. Firstly, as committed during the Sendai conference, India has successfully hosted the Asian in Ministerial Conference on Disaster Reduction (AMCDRR) November, 2016 and adopted &#39;New Delhi Declaration and &#39;Regional Action Plan for implementation of the Sendai Framework&#39;.</p>
<p>Secondly, Government of India has issued a set of priority actions to all the State Government based on thr goals,targets and priorities of Sendai Framework 2015-2030.Government of india,during AMCDRR,2016,has extended the grant of US$1 milion to UNISDR towards effective implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk RedUction in the Asian region.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in line with Sendai priority 4, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is strengthened, both in terms of state-of-the-art training and equipment to as to further empower it as a professional disaster response force. Besides, Government of India has approved the creation of National Disaster Response Reserve (NDRR) through a revolving fund of Its. 250 crore to be operated by the National Disaster Response Force.</p>
<p><strong>New Delhi Declaration</strong></p>
<p>The &#39;New Delhi Declaration&#39; is a political statement spelling out the commitment of participating governments towards preventing and reducing disaster risk, and strengthening the resilience of communities, nations in the Asian region. Recognising the need to accelerate the implementation of global frameworks, it commits to a people-centred and whole-of-society approach towards DRR. It also emphasises the need to enhance the capacity of communities and ensure participation of all stakeholder groups towards achieving resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Asian Regional Plan</strong></p>
<p>The &#39;Asian Regional Plan for Implementation of the Sendai Framework&#39; focuses on the &#39;How to&#39; reduce disaster risk at national and local levels. It has arrived at a longer term road map of cooperation and collaboration, spanning the 15-year horizon of the Sendai Framework, as well as a two-year action plan to further disaster risk reduction with specific, actionable activities.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the government expressed keenness to share India&#39;s expertise and help other countries in disaster response as it did during Japan Earthquake in 2011 and Nepal earthquake of 2015. The government of India is making consistent efforts to promote regional cooperation by hosting the SAARC Disaster Managenient Centre to reduce disaster risks in the region and promoting knowledge sharing among the SAARC countries. SAARC Management Exercise (SAADMEX) 2015 held in Delhi provided ideal platform for sharing the government&#39;s ideas and experience and reaffirmed its commitment to strengthen the institutional mechanism of regional cooperation on disaster response among the member countries.</p></div>
  <div class="menu-content And"><p>people as a result of a combination of factors like resources depletion, the irreversible destruction of the environment and population growth among others. Because of its sub&not;continental dimensions, geographical situation and behaviour of the monsoon, India is exposed to the various natural hazards and disasters like drought, flood, cyclone, earthquake, etc., year after year.</p>
<p>There are far too many variables and factors that determine when the sea would give rise to a tsunami, cyclone, tornado or typhoon. We can only set-up monitoring stations with a hope that early warning could help in sallievacuation of people or allow them to take appropriate measures to cope with &#39;such natural disasters when the sea unleashes tremendous forces. Management of natural disasters is not</p>
<p>&bull; easy, given the fact that these are too sudden and unexpected and too massive to deal with.</p>
<p>While all the States and Union Territories in India are likely to face one or a combination of digaster situation, 20 States 7 Union Territories are more vulnerable to these disaster. For major disaster which adversely affect different parts of the country are drought, flood, cyclone and earthquake. Only one state (West Bengal), faces all four types of disaster, seven states face three types of disasters, ten face two types of disasters and nine states face one type of disaster.</p>
<p>It has been estimate that 55% of our landmass is prone to earthquakes of various intensities, about 68 percent of total sown area of the country is susceptible to drought, over 46 million hectares or over 12 percent is prone to floods and 8% is prone to cyclones.</p>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content India"><h1>India&#39;s Key Vulnerabilities</h1>
<hr>
<p>55 percent of the total area is in Seismic Zones III-IV and vulnerable to earthquakes. 68 percent of net sown area is vulnerable to drought. so million hectare is vulnerable to floods. 8 percent of the total land urea particularly along the eastern coast and Gujarat coast is vulnerable to tropical cyclones. Sub-Himalayan region and Western Ghats areas are vulnerable to landslides. The entire coastal area, particularly, the east coast is vulnerable to tsunamis.</p>
<p><strong>Earthquakes</strong></p>
<p>Earthquakes are the result of forces deep within the earth&#39;s interior. Sudden break within the upper layers of the earth, sometimes breaking the surface, resulting in the vibration of the ground, which are strong enough will cause the collapse of buildings and destruction of life and property. They strike with no early warning and can be devastating, but after a major one, aftershocks may be as strong as a new earthquake.</p>
<p>Nearly 95 percent of the earthquake activities in the world occur at the plate boundaries. The earthquakes generated in this Way are most damaging. Indian plate extends from the Himalayas beyond the Andamans and Java, Sumatra to Australia where it touches the pacific plate. It is moving in a gfrri8-mtiKttalliiir&sect;cjiaoA4,4 ran average velocity of about 5 cm per year. It encounters the adjacent plates in Myanmar. Andaman Sumatra region in the east, the Himalayan foothilh in the north and Suleman ranges of Pakistan in the west Great earthquakes in Shillong (1.897), Kangra (1905), Bihar-Nepal (1934) and Assam (1950) have occurred on the northern boundary of the Indian plate which is underthrusting the Eurasian plate.</p>
<p>Plate tectonics does not offer a satisfactory explanation for earthquakes occurring within the plate itself Prior to this, the great Rann of Kaclichh earthquake (1819) located far away from the boundary of the Indian Plate could also not be accounted for by the plate tectonics model:This quake reduced Bhuj town into ruins, killing about 2000 persons in Bhuj town alone. Seismologists believe that this quake was associated with perceptible fault. The resulting fault scarp brought into existence in the Rann of Kachchh, is known as Allah Bund&#39;. The intraplate stress is due to the fact that not every part of the plate is similar and these are weak zones and faults. This is known as stable continental region earthquake. This type of earthquake is rare. Latur (1995) belonged to this category.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Reservoir Induced Seismicity (RIS)</strong></p>
<p>The Koyna earthquake (1967) could not be explained on the basis of intraplate tectonics with any degree of satisfaction as a result of which, some geologists and seismologists turned to the theory of reservoir induced seismicity in a big way This theory assumes that the load of the huge volume of water impounded can trigger a quake by destabilising a fault and therefore the early studies were mainly directed to correlating local seismic events to fluctuations of water levels in the reservoirs.</p>
<p><strong>Major Earthquake prone zones in India</strong></p>
<p>Depending upon the frequency and intensity of the earthquakes, the whole country can be divided into three broad seismological zones.</p>
<p><strong>Himalayan Zone:</strong> The areas most prone to earthquakes in India are the fold mountain ranges of the Himalayan zone. The states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, the Bihar-Nepal border, and the North Eastern states, especially Assam, fall in this zone. The Himalayas have not yet attained isostatic equilibrium and are rising. The region alone the Himalayas where two plates meet is highly earthquake prone. This is known as the zone of maximum intensity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The Indo-Gangetic Zone:</strong>To the south of die Himalayan zone and the running parallel, it is the Indo-Gangetic zone. Most of the earthquakes striking this zone are of moderate intensity of 6 to 6.5 on Richter settle. Therefore, this zone is. called the zone of comparative intensity. The earthquakes, along the foothill are of medium to high intensity. However, the earthquakes of this zone are more harmful.due to the high density of population in this area.</p>
<p><strong>The Peninsular Zone:</strong> The Peninsular India has presumably remained a stable landmass and only a few earthquakes have been experienced in this region. This region is therefore, called the zone of minimum intensity. But severe earthquakes of Koyna (1967), Latur (1993) and Jabalpur (1997) have raised doubts about the seismic stability of this landmass.</p>
<p><strong>Major Recent Earthquakes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bhuj:</strong> On the fateful day of 9.6th January, 2001, the earth shook in Bhuj and nearby towns and villages devastating whole villages and towns where houses and buildings collapsed like a pack of cards.</p>
<p><strong>Kashmir and Pakistan</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the &#39;worst earthquakes in the subcontinent hit Pakistan on October, 2005, with its epicenter near Muzaffarabad in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POE). The earthquake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and caused widespread damage in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. It is estimated that more than 73,000 might have been killed in Pakistan alone with lakhs injured. Many buildings have been rased to the ground. In Jammu &amp; Kashmir inore than 2000 persons have died, with thousands injured. Some villages have been rased to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Earthquake Management</strong></p>
<p>Earthquake does not kill but a collapsed building does. That is the &#39;lesson some of the quake prone countries like Japan have learnt over the years. Japanese, having an earthquake is a &#39;normal&#39; occurrence and no one panics. Their buildings, bridges and roads are designed to stand severe earthquakes without much damage. We cannot preventearthquakes but we can reduce the potential damages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Development of possible warning indicators.</li>
    <li>Lind-use regulations.</li>
    <li>Building regulations.</li>
    <li>Relocation of communities.</li>
    <li>Public awareness and education prograths</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tsunami&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Tsunami is derived from the Japanese word &#39;tsu&#39; meaning harbour and &#39;narni&#39; meaning wave. 4 tsunaini is a series of waves caused by a rapid displacement of a body of water (ocein, lake). Tsunamis are waves generated by earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, or underwater landslides and can reach 15km or more height devastating costal communications.The waves are characterised by a very long wavelength and their amplitude is much smaller offshore. The impact in costal areas can be very destructive as the waves advance inland and can extend over thousands of kilometers. Triggers of a tsunami can be: earthquakes, volcanic eruption mass movements, meteorite impacts or underwater explosions. A killer tsunami hit It south eastern Countries of Asia on the 26th December 2004 killing more than 1,50,000 precious lives. The emotional, economical and ecological toll of the disaster can&#39;t be calculated. Many village have lost an entire generation.</p>
<p><strong>Advance Warnings about Tsunamis</strong></p>
<p>The best way of escaping the fury of the killing tsunami waves is to give advance warning of impending tsunamis to the vulnerable communities. Following few tips will help the common man to apprehend the danger of tsunamis:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If there is a major undersea earthquake, beware of the danger because tsunamis could reach the coast in a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Shaking of ground is a sufficient warning for the people living inthe coastal areas about the impending tsunami.</li>
    <li>A perceptible rapid rise or fall in coastal water can also be taken as a forewarning an approaching tsunami.</li>
    <li>Coastal areas less than eight meters above sea level run the greatest risk of an attack by tsunamis. They should be immediately evacuated if there is danger of an approaching tsunami.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tsunami Warning System in India</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately India and other Indian Ocean rim countries did not have tsunami warning system before 26th December 2004 when the deadly-tsunamis hit the coasts of Indian Ocean. Had public warnings been issued about the killing tsunami waves across the Indian Ocean, thousands of lives and property worth billions of rupees could be saved as the tsunami which hit the Sumatra Island took about three hours to crash into the Indian Coast. After the catastrophe, India has decided to install her own tsunami warning system at the cost of Rs. 125 crore rather than becoming a part of the Pacific Warning System. There is a plan to put 6 to 12 Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) Systems, six km under the sea surface. Like the Pacific DART system, this system also will be able to record even one centimeter difference in the size of waves. The DART will be attached to buoys linked to satellites and land stations for real time recording of the height of waves. It is hoped that the system will become functional by the year 2007. The system using platform of Global Ocean Observing system will meet the needs of the Indian Ocean Rim nations. The member states will have to set up their own receiving stations to get networked with the Indian system. Special early warning system will be set up along the fault lines stretching from Java-Sumatra to Myanmar and in Kachchh in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p><strong>Landslides</strong></p>
<p>A landslide, also known as a landslip, is a form of mass wasting that includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Landslides can occur in underwater, called a submarine landslide, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force fora landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Factors</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Intensity of rainfall</li>
    <li>Steep slopes</li>
    <li>Stiffness of slopes</li>
    <li>Highly weathered rock layers</li>
    <li>Soil layers formed under gravity</li>
    <li>Seismic activity</li>
    <li>Poor drainage</li>
    <li>Man-made Factors</li>
    <li>Deforestation leading to soil erosion</li>
    <li>Non-engineered excavation</li>

<p><strong>Drought</strong></p>
<p>Drought is a temporary reduction in water or moisture availability significantly below the normal or expected amount for a specific period. According to High Powered Committee on Disaster Management Report, &quot;Any lack of water to satisfy the normal needs of agricultural, livestock, industry or human population ,may be termed as a drought&quot; This condition occurs either due to inadequacy of rainfall, or lack of irrigation facilities, under-exploitation or deficient availability of water for meeting the normal crop requirements in the context of the agroclimatic conditions prevailing in any particular area.</p>
<p>The inadequacy is with reference to the prevailing agro&not;climatic conditions in any particular area. Therefore, there is a drought in Jaisalmer (Average rainfall 200 mm) if rainfall is not sufficient to grow grass and paltry coarse-grains, whereas in Bolangir or Koraput (Orissa-rainfall above 1,000 mm), there is a drought if there is not enough rainfall for bringing the paddy crop to maturity.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Drought</strong></p>
<p>Following main types of drought may be recognised: Meteorological Drought: It describes a situation where there is a reduction in rainfall for a specific period (days, month, seasons or year) below a specific amount (long term average fora specific time). The Indian Meteorological Department (IMP) has defined drought as a situation occurring in any area when the mean annual rainfall is less than 75% of the normal rainfall, IMP has further classified droughts into the broad categories viz. a severe drought when the deficiency of rainfall exceeds 50% of the normal rainfall and moderate drought when the deficiency of rainfall is between 25 and 50% of the normal rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrological Drought</strong></p>
<p>Hydrological drought is associated with reduction of water. A meteorological drought often leads to hydrological drought. Generally it takes two successive meteorological droughts before the hydrological drought sets in. There,are two types of hydrological droughts viz.:</p>
<ul>
    <li>surface water drought and</li>
    <li>ground water drought.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agricultural Drought</strong></p>
<p>Agricultural drought is concerned with the Impact of meteorological/hydrological drought on crop yield. When soil moisture and rainfall conditions are not adequate enough to support a healthy crop growth to maturity thereby causing extreme moisture stress and wilting of major crop area, it leads to agricultural drought. Agricultural drought may occur even when there is no meteorological drought vice-versa. It is worth noting that agricultural drought is a relative category, depending upon the value of plant and soil.</p>
<p><strong>Soil Moisture Drought</strong></p>
<p>This is a situation of inadequate soil moisture particularly in rainfed areas which may not support crop growth. This happens in the event of a meteorological drought when the water supply to soil is less and water loss by evaporation is more.</p>
<p><strong>Socio-Economic Drought</strong></p>
<p>It reflects the reduction of availability of food and income lass on account of crop failures endangering food and social security of the people in the affected areas. Famine A famine occurs when large scale collapse of access to food occurs which, without intervention, can lead to mass starvation.</p>
<p><strong>Ecological Drought</strong></p>
<p>Ecological drought takes place when the productivity of a natural ecosystem fails significantly as a consequence of distress induced environmental damage.</p>
<p><strong>Drought Prone Areas in India</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>There are some well-defined tracts of drought which are briefly described.</li>
    <li>The desert and semi-desert region covering about 6 lakh sq. km. It is more or less a rectangle formed by lines from Ahmedabad to Kanpur on one side and from Kanpur to Jalandhar on the other.</li>
    <li>The dry region lying in the beside of the Western Ghats upto a width of 300 km stretching eastwards up to too km from the East Coast and reaching right upto the southern tip of the peninsula. It covers an area of about 3.7 lakh sq. km.</li>
    <li>Outside the above mentioned two major region, there are isolated pockets which experience frequent droughts and are termed as drought prone areas. They are: &mdash;s Coimbatore and Nellai Kottahomman districts in Tamil Nadu;</li>
</ul>
<p> Souraslitra and Kachchli regions;</p>
<p>- Jhansi, Lalitpur, Banda, Mirzapur, Philibliit, Mier&#39;&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Bahraich districts of Uttar Pradesh;</p>
<p>- Palamau plateau of Jharkhand;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Purulia district of West Bengal; and</p>
<p>- Kalahandi region of Orissa;</p>
<p>&mdash;s Large parts of Uttaranchal; and</p>
<p>- Jammu and Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir. These scattered pockets account for about one lakh sq. km.</p>
<p><strong>Drought Management</strong></p>
<p>Government has launched various programmes for Drought management in India since independence like Drought Prone Area Programme, Integrated Watershed Management, etc. Following steps can be taken for effective drought management.</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp; Rush water/fodder through tankers to affected areas.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Recharge underground springs by building mini and checkdams.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Restore traditional water-bodies like village tanks, wells and underground storage tanks.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Teach how to harvest the meagre rain that falls in the drought prone areas.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Encourage use of drip and sprinkler irrigation that saves water.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Adopt cultivation of crops that use less water.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Use drought-resistant variety of seeds.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; Involve local people in all the planning and execution of projects that would make the village self-sufficient in water. Encourage villagers to pool and share their knowledge on water management through traditional systems in vogue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Floods</strong></p>
<p>Flood is a state of high water level along a river channel or on coast that leads to inundation of land which is normally submerged. Flood is an important component of hydrological cycle of a drainage basin. As a matter of fact droughts and floods are two extreme ends of the hydrological cycle. While droughts occur due to failure of rainfall caused by the southwest monsoons, floods occur in the event of excessive rainfall.</p>
<p>In modern times, annual floods due to swollen rivers have become severe causing untold loss to human beings, animals and property. This happens with sickening frequency especially in Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Other parts of the country too are subjected to floods due to over flowing rivers, streams and tanks that overflow due to heavy intake.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Floods</strong></p>
<p>Following are the major causes of floods in India: Meteorological Factors</p>
<ul>
    <li>Heavy Rainfall</li>
    <li>Tropical Cyclones</li>
    <li>Cloud Burst</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical Factors</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Large Catchment Area Human Factors</li>
    <li>Deforestation</li>
    <li>Faulty Agricultural Practices</li>
    <li>Bursting of Danis</li>
    <li>Inadequate Drainage Arrangement</li>
    <li>Siltation</li>
    <li>Faulty Irrigation Practices</li>
    <li>Accelerated Urbanisation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flood Disaster Management</strong></p>
<p>The main stemps for flood disaster management are briefly discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Flood Forecasting:</strong> Flood forecasting involent giving prior information regarding the occurrence of &#39;floods. This is essential and is extremely useful for taking timely action to prevent loss of human lives, livestock and movable property. The Central Water Commission (CWC) started flood forecasting in November 1958 when the first forecasting station was established at Old Railway Bridge, Delhi. Since then it has been extended to cover almost all the major inter-state flood prone rivers of the country. At !resent there are 100 flood forecasting stations on various rivers in the country which includes is. level foreatsting and 52 inflow forecasting stations.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction of Runoff:</strong> Reduction of runoff is one of the very effective methods of flood disaster management. Runoff can be reduced by inducing and increasing infiltration of the surface seater into the ground in the catchment area. This can be done by large scale afforestation particularly in the catchment area. In the ludo-Gangetic plain, the runoff can be reduced by artificially inducing infiltration by digging wells along the beds of ephermal channels. A series of dug wells helps in storing and channelising the surface water.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Flood Peaks by Volume Reduction (Constructing Dams and Detention Basins):</strong> The flood peaks can be reduced by construction of dams and detention basins. Dams have the capacity of holding huge quantity of water during the flood period and help in reducing flood peak volume of water. Water stored in reservoirs created by constructing dams can be allowed to flow down the stream under controlled conditions depending upon the accommodating capacity of the river downstream the dam.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Flood Levels</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stream Channelisation:</strong> A close network of canals reduces flood hazard to a great extent because flood water flowing in the river can be diverted to canals.</li>
    <li><strong>Channel Improvement:</strong> Channel improvement is done by deepening, widening, straightening, lining and cleaning out of vegetation and debris from the river channel. These changes in the river channel increase the flood conveyance capacity of the river.</li>
    <li><strong>Flood Diversion:</strong> Flood diversion is the process. of diverting the flood water in marshes, lakes, the depressions and spreading it thinly over paddy fields and desert drylands. One such scheme in the Ghaggar Reversion &nbsp;Scheme which diverts 340 cubic metres (cubic metres per second) of water before its entry into Rajasthan into the depression and the areas between the sand dunes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protection against Inundation (Construction of Embankments):</strong> Building of embankments was cont es still to be the only way of controlling floods in 1940s.It is still &nbsp;considered to be one of the very effective devices against inundation of the inhabited areas and agricultural Construction of embankments has &nbsp;up large scale in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Most of the embankments constructed in north India where the Brahmaputra valley of Assam, northern parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh (Gangs, Yamuna and Ghaghara) and Punjab (Satluj, Beas and Ravi) are the main beneficiaries. In south India, embankments have been constructed mainly in the deltaic parts 61 the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and along the banks of Penneru.</p>
<p><strong>Flood Plain Zoning (FPZ):</strong> Flood plain zoning is another very effective method of flood management. It is based on information regarding flood plains, particularly the identification of flood ways in relation to land use. Detailed maps of flood prone areas are prepared after a thorough study of flood cycles. Some areas are more prone to floods than the others. Different zones are identified and demarcated. After that necessary control is exercised with respect to land use. &#39;A&#39; is the main channel of the river. It is the flood way which is totally prohibited zone. No construction is allowed in this zone. Area &#39;BB&#39; is the regulatory flowing fringe and marks the extent inundation design flood. This is called restrictive zone. Beyond that is the secondary hazard zone marked by &#39;CC&#39;. This is the extent of largest flood expected.</p>

    <p><strong>Glacier Melting</strong></p>
    <p>A few of the glaciers around the world are melting due to climate changes and man-made destructive activities such as tourist influx to sensitive mountainous regions, deforestation, and forest burning. The Gangotri glacier from which emerges the Bhagirathi, later on to become Ganga, is shrinking at the Gaumukh glaciers, from whose snout the river emerges. It has already receded a few km in recent times and this process is continuing unabated. This is also true of the many Himalayan glaciers as well glaciers in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The consequences of glacial melting are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flooding of oceans and downstream areas.</li>
        <li>Shortage of water in rivers due to shrinking of glacier, which feed the rivers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A few remedial measures that could be taken to reverse the trend of glacial melting are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) that control global warming.</li>
        <li>Minimise human activity in and around the glaciers by regulating treks and number of visitors at a time.</li>
        <li>Plant trees</li>
        <li>Prevent deforestation</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Volcanic Eruption&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>These can .be spectacularly dangerous. Fortunately, we have very few volcanoes that become active. Mostly, these have occurred in other countries like Italy Mexico, Pacific islands like Hawaii, Peru, and Indonesia. Mt. Et., in Sicily, Italy is it live volcano that becomes active once in a any Sometimes there are indications that a dormant volcano is becoming active again with molt, gases and tire emanating from vents. New vents are formed volcanic ash and molten lava that gets solidified, Mock the old. It is best the people near these volcanoes take precautions and move out to safer places belbre a big disaster striko. The only safety in to stay as far away as possible from the volcano.</p>





</div>
  <div class="menu-content Building"><p>Earthquakes</p>
<p>Earthquakes are the result of forces deep within the earth&#39;s interior. Sudden break within the upper layers of the earth, sometimes breaking the surface, resulting in the vibration of the ground, which are strong enough will cause the collapse of buildings and destruction of life and property. They strike with no early warning and can be devastating, but after a major one, aftershocks may be as strong as a new earthquake.</p>
<p>Nearly 95 percent of the earthquake activities in the world occur at the plate boundaries. The earthquakes generated in this Way are most damaging. Indian plate extends from the Himalayas beyond the Andamans and Java, Sumatra to Australia where it touches the pacific plate. It is moving in a gfrri8-mtiKttalliiir&sect;cjiaoA4,4 ran average velocity of about 5&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cm per year. It encounters the adjacent plates in Myanmar. Andaman Sumatra region in the east, the Himalayan foothilh in the north and Suleman ranges of Pakistan in the west Great earthquakes in Shillong (1.897), Kangra (1905), Bihar-Nepal (1934) and Assam (1950) have occurred on the northern boundary of the Indian plate which is underthrusting the Eurasian plate. &bull;</p>
<p>Plate tectonics does not offer a satisfactory explanation for earthquakes occurring within the plate itself Prior to this, the great Rann of Kaclichh earthquake (1819) located far away from the boundary of the Indian Plate could also not be accounted for by the plate tectonics model:This quake reduced Bhuj town into ruins, killing about 2000 persons in Bhuj town alone. Seismologists believe that this quake was associated with perceptible fault. The resulting fault scarp brought into existence in the Rann of Kachchh, is known as Allah Bund&#39;. The intraplate stress is due to the fact that not every part of the plate is similar and these are weak zones and faults. This is known as stable continental region earthquake. This type of earthquake is rare. Latur (1995) belonged to this category.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reservoir Induced Seismicity (RIS)</p>
<p>The Koyna earthquake (1967) could not be explained on the basis of intraplate tectonics with any degree of satisfaction as a result of which, some geologists and seismologists turned to the theory of reservoir induced seismicity in a big way This theory assumes that the load of the huge volume of water impounded can trigger a quake by destabilising a fault and therefore the early studies were mainly directed to correlating local seismic events to fluctuations of water levels in the reservoirs.</p>
<p>Major Earthquake prone zones in India</p>
<p>Depending upon the frequency and intensity of the earthquakes, the whole country can be divided into three broad seismological zones.</p>
<p>Himalayan Zone: The areas most prone to earthquakes in India are the fold mountain ranges of the Himalayan zone. The states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, the Bihar-Nepal border, and the North Eastern states, especially Assam, fall in this zone. The Himalayas have not yet attained isostatic equilibrium and are rising. The region alone the Himalayas where two plates meet is highly earthquake prone. This is known as the zone of maximum intensity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Indo-Gangetic Zone To the south of die Himalayan zone and the running parallel, it is the Indo-Gangetic zone. Most of the earthquakes striking this zone are of moderate intensity of 6 to 6.5 on Richter settle. Therefore, this zone is. called the zone of comparative intensity. The earthquakes, along the foothill are of medium to high intensity. However, the earthquakes of this zone are more harmful.due to the high density of population in this area.</p>
<p>The Peninsular Zone: The Peninsular India has presumably remained a stable landmass and only a few earthquakes have been experienced in this region. This region is therefore, called the zone of minimum intensity. But severe earthquakes of Koyna (1967), Latur (1993) and Jabalpur (1997) have raised doubts about the seismic stability of this landmass.</p>
<p>Major Recent Earthquakes</p>
<p>Bhuj: On the fateful day of 9.6th January, 2001, the earth shook in Bhuj and nearby towns and villages devastating whole villages and towns where houses and buildings collapsed like a pack of cards.</p>
<p>Kashmir and Pakistan &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the &#39;worst earthquakes in the subcontinent hit Pakistan on October, 2005, with its epicenter near Muzaffarabad in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POE). The earthquake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and caused widespread damage in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. It is estimated that more than 73,000 might have been killed in</p>
<p>&bull; Pakistan alone with lakhs injured. Many buildings have been rased to the ground. In Jammu &amp; Kashmir inore than 2000 persons have died, with thousands injured. Some villages have been rased to the ground.</p>
<p>Earthquake Management</p>
<p>Earthquake does not kill but a collapsed building does. That is the &#39;lesson some of the quake prone countries like Japan have learnt over the years. Japanese, having an earthquake is a &#39;normal&#39; occurrence and no one panics. Their buildings, bridges and roads are designed to stand severe earthquakes without much damage. We cannot preventearthquakes but we can reduce the potential damages:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of possible warning indicators.</p>
<p>&bull; Lind-use regulations.</p>
<p>&bull; Building regulations.</p>
<p>&bull; Relocation of communities.</p>
<p>&bull; Public awareness and education prograths</p>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content Tsunami"><p>Tsunami&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tsunami is derived from the Japanese word &#39;tsu&#39; meaning harbour and &#39;narni&#39; meaning wave. 4 tsunaini is a series of waves caused by a rapid displacement of a body of water (ocein, lake). Tsunamis are waves generated by earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, or underwater landslides and can rea</p>
<p>waves are characterised by a very long wavel amplitude is much smaller offshore. The impact in costal areas can be very destructive as the waves advance inland and can extend over thousands of kilometers. Triggers of a tsunami can be: earthquakes, volcanic eruption mass movements, meteorite impacts or underwater explosions. A killer tsunami hit It south eastern Countries of Asia on the 26th December 2004 killing more than 1,50,000 precious lives. The emotional, economical and ecological toll of the disaster can&#39;t be calculated. Many villageihave lost an entire generation.</p>
<p>Advance Warnings about Tsunamis</p>
<p>The best way of escaping the fury of the killing tsunami waves is to give advance warning of impending tsunamis to the vulnerable communities. Following few tips will help the common man to apprehend the danger of tsunamis:</p>
<p>&bull; If there is a major undersea earthquake, beware of the danger because tsunamis could reach the coast in a few minutes.</p>
<p>&bull; Shaking of ground is a sufficient warning for the people living inthe coastal areas about the impending tsunami.</p>
<p>&bull; A perceptible rapid rise or fall in coastal water can also&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; be taken as a forewarning an approaching tsunami.</p>
<p>&bull; Coastal areas less than eight metres above sea level run the greatest risk of an attack by tsunamis. They should be immediately evacuated if there is danger of an approaching tsunami.</p>
<p>Tsunami Warning System in India</p>
<p>Unfortunately India and other Indian Ocean rim countries did not have tsunami warning system before 26th Decembe r 2004 when the deadly-tsunamis hit the coasts of Indian Ocean. Had public warnings been issued about the killing tsunami waves across the Indian Ocean, thousands of lives and property worth billions of rupees could be saved as the tsunami which hit the Sumatra Island took about three hours to crash into the Indian Coast. After the catastrophe, India has decided to install her own tsunami warning system at the cost of Rs. 125 crore rather than becoming a part of the Pacific Warning System. There is a plan to put 6 to 12 Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) Systems, six km under the sea surface. Like the Pacific DART system, this system also will be able to record even one centimetre difference in the size of waves. The DART will be attached to buoys linked to satellites and land stations for real time recording of the height of waves. It is hoped that the system will become functional by the year 2007. The system using platform of Global Ocean Observing system will meet the needs of the Indian Ocean Rim nations. The member states will have to set up their own receiving stations to get networked with the Indian system. Special</p>
<p>early warning system will be set up along the fault lines stretching from Java-Sumatra to Myanmar and in Kachchh in the Arabian Sea.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Landslides"><p>Landslides</p>
<p>A landslide, also known as a landslip, is a form of mass wasting that includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows.

Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force fora landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability.</p>

<p>In modern times, annual floods due to swollen rivers have become severe causing untold loss to human beings, animals and property. This happens with sickening frequency especially in Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Other parts of the country too are subjected to floods due to over flowing rivers, streams and tanks that overflow due to heavy intake.</p>
<p>Causes of Floods</p>
<p>Following are the major causes of floods in India: Meteorological Factors</p>
<p>&bull; Heavy Rainfall</p>
<p>&bull; Tropical Cyclones</p>
<p>&bull; Cloud Burst</p>
<p>Physical Factors</p>
<p>&bull; Large Catchment Area Human Factors</p>
<p>&bull; Deforestation</p>
<p>&bull; Faulty Agricultural Practices</p>
<p>&bull; Bursting of Danis</p>
<p>&bull; inadequate Drainage Arrangement</p>
<p>&bull; Siltation</p>
<p>&bull; Faulty Irrigation Practices</p>
<p>&bull; Accelerated Urbanisation</p>

<p>Flood Disaster Management</p>
<p>The main stemps for flood disaster management are briefly discussed below:</p>
<p>Flood Forecasting: Flood forecasting involent giving prior information regarding the occurrence of &#39;floods. This is essential and is extremely useful for taking timely action to prevent loss of human lives, livestock and movable property. The Central Water Commission (CWC) started flood forecasting in November 1958 when the first forecasting station was established at Old Railway Bridge, Delhi. Since then it has been extended to cover almost all the major inter-state flood prone rivers of the country. At !resent there are 100 flood forecasting stations on various rivers in the country which includes is. level foreatsting and 52 inflow forecasting stations.</p>
<p>Reduction of Runoff: Reduction of runoff is one of the very effective methods of flood disaster management. Runoff can be reduced by inducing and increasing infiltration of the surface seater into the ground in the catchment area. This can be done by large scale afforestation particularly in the catchment area. In the ludo-Gangetic plain, the runoff can be reduced by artificially inducing infiltration by digging wells along the beds of ephermal channels. A series of dug wells helps in storing and channelising the surface water.</p>
<p>Reducing Flood Peaks by Volume Reduction (Constructing Dams and Detention Basins): The flood peaks can be reduced by construction of dams and detention basins. Dams &bull;have the capacity of holding huge quantity of water during the flood period and help in reducing flood peak volume of water. Water stored in reservoirs created by constructing dams can be allowed to flow down the stream under controlled conditions depending upon the accommodating capacity of the river downstream the dam.</p>
<p>Reducing Flood Levels</p>
<p>&bull; Stream Channelisation: A close network of canals reduces flood hazard to a great extent because flood water flowing in the river can be diverted to canals.</p>
<p>&bull; Channel Improvement: Channel improvement is done by deepening, widening, straightening, lining and cleaning out of vegetation and debris from the river channel. These changes in the river channel increase the flood conveyance capacity of the river.</p>
<p>&bull; Flood Diversion: Flood diversion is the process. of diverting the flood water in marshes, lakes, the depressions and spreading it thinly over paddy fields and desert drylands. One such scheme in the Ghaggar Reversion &nbsp;Scheme which diverts 340 cu mecs (cubic metres per</p>
<p>second) of water before its entry into Rajasthan into the depression and the areas between the sand dunes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection against Inundation (Construction of Embankments): Building of embankments was cont es stillto be the only way of controlling floods in 19905. i &nbsp;considered to be one of the very effective devicesagiaai:dst. inundation of the inhabited areas and agricultural Construction of embankments has &nbsp;up&nbsp;</p>
<p>large scale in India. Most of the embankments constructed in north India where the Brahmaputra valley of Assam, northern parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh (Gangs, Yamuna and Ghaghara) and Punjab (Satluj, Beas and Ravi) are the main beneficiaries. In south India, embankments have been constructed mainly in the deltaic parts 61 the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and along the banks of Penneru.</p>
<p>Flood Plain Zoning (FPZ): Flood plain zoning is another very effective method of flood management. It is based on information regarding flood plains, particularly the identification of flood ways in relation to land use. Detailed maps of flood prone areas are prepared after a thorough study of flood cycles. Some areas are more prone to floods than the others. Different zones are identified and demarcated. After that necessary control is exercised with respect to land use. A&bull; is the main channel of the river. It is the flood way which is totally prohibited zone. No construction is allowed in this zone. Area &#39;BB&#39; is the regulatory flowing fringe and marks the extent inundation design flood. This is called restrictive zone. Beyond that is the secondary hazard zone marked by &#39;CC&#39;. This is the extent of largest flood expected.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Glacier">
<p>Glacier Melting</p>
<p>A few of the glact s around the world are melting due to climate changes and man-made destructive activities such as tourist influx to sensitive mountainous regions, deforestation, and forest burning. The Gangotri glacier from which emerges the Bhagirathi, later on to become Ganga, is shrinking at the Gaumukh glaciers, from whose snout the river emerges. It has already receded a few km in recent times and this process is continuing unabated. This is also true of the many Himalayan glaciers as well glaciers in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The consequences of glacial melting are:</p>
<p>&bull; Flooding of oceans and downstream areas.</p>
<p>&bull; Shortage of water in rivers due to shrinking of glacier, which feed the rivers.</p>
<p>A few remedial measures that could be taken to reverse the trend of glacial melting are</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) that control global warming.</p>
<p>&bull; &bull; Minimise human activity in and around the glaciers by&nbsp;</p>
<p>regulating treks and number of visitors at a time.</p>
<p>&bull; Plant trees</p>
<p>&bull; Prevent deforestation</p>

  <div class="menu-content Volcanic"><p><strong>Volcanic Eruption </strong></p>
<p>These can .be spectacularly dangerous. Fortunately, we have very few volcanoes that become active. Mostly, these have occurred in other countries like Italy Mexico, Pacific islands like Hawaii, Peru, and Indonesia. Mt. Et., in Sicily, Italy is it live volcano that becomes active once in a any Sometimes there are indications that a dormant volcano is becoming active again with molt, gases and tire emanating from vents. New vents are formed volcanic ash and molten lava that gets solidified, Mock the old. It is best the people near these volcanoes take precautions and move out to safer places belbre a big disaster striko. The only safety in to stay as far away as possible from the volcano.</p>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content Man-made"><p><strong>Man-Made Disasters and Management</strong></p>
<p>Some major accidents and disasters occurring at regular intervals in our country can be classified as man-made disaster, since they have their roots in the activitio of man. NI:tat-made disasters can be many, especially in today&#39;s context of a technology driven society. To name a few man-made disasters: oil spill, oil tires, leakage of radioactive material from nuclear power plants, dumping of toxic and hazardous wastes polluting the soil, water and air, mercury contamination that can cause severe health problem, epidemics. fire that engulfs buildings, terrorist attack, rail, road, boat and plane accidents, bursting of dams and reservoirs, hazardous electric wiring that could lead to short circuit and increased risk of fire, storing of hazardous chemicals without safety precautions and the list is endless.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Floods"><p><strong>Management of Urban Floods: Case Study of Mumbai Floods, 2005</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lessons:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The limitations of the weather prediction and early warning system were exposed.</li>
    <li>Response of Government agencies was quick. Army was deployed within 12hrs hours of heavy rainfall on the first day i.e. 27th July, 2005.</li>
    <li>Declaration of holidays on 27th and 28th July, 2005 reduced distress.</li>
    <li>Civil society responded in a highway.</li>
    <li>Massive immunisation and effective mobilisation of health services prevented major epidemic.</li>
    <li>While unprecedented rainfall was.the main reason fiw the Munthai flood in atos, major contributing factors were unplanned urban development in complete disregard of the delicate environment and ecology of the area.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The drainage system was clogged by solid wastes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The Disaster Management Plan was not updated.</li>
    <li>Community was not involved in the planning process. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crowd Management Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;There are separate entry and exit points at stations to facilitate easy ingress and egress of passengers. The entry and exit points are being manned by staff of Railway commercial department and RPF/GRP at major and important railway stations, round the clock.</li>
    <li>Queue system is maintained for hassle free boarding of passengers in general coaches of important trains at originating stations.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Parking and non-parking areas have clearly been demarcated to avoid haphazard parking and overcrowding.</li>
    <li>Traffic regulations are implemented in coordination with Trallic/Lool Police.</li>
    <li>During festive season, special deployment of commercial and security personnel is made.</li>
    <li>E-ticket booking system, automatic ticket vending t.chines, city booking office, mobile app etc. have been provided at important stations/cities for the convenience of passengers and to reduce rush at passenger reservation systems and booking offices at the stations.</li>
    <li>In order to decongest the platform the rate of platform tickets has been increased from B5 to C10 from 01.04.2015. Further, the power has also been delegated to Divisional Railway Managers to increase the rate of platform tickets beyond Rs.10 to regulate rush at platforms during specific requirements like mela, rally etc.</li>
    <li>Close Circuit Television Surveillance System, Access Control Mechanism are used to regulate and monitor the crowd at major railway stations in general and specifically during festive seasons and other such occasions, in addition to adequate deployment of staff&#39; in coordination with concerned Government Railway Police/Local Police and Station Manager.</li>

  <div class="menu-content Radiological"><p><strong>Management of Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies</strong></p>
<p>The National Vision is to prevent nuclear and radiological emergencies which are essentially man-made in nature. llowevcr, in rare cases or their occurrence, due to natural or man-made factors beyond human control, such emergencies will be so managed through certain pre-planned and established structural and non-structural measures by the various stakeholders, as to minimise risks to health, life and the environment. The response to the nuclear/radiological emergencies has its own objectives and principles, such as mitigation of accidents.at source; prevention of deterministic health effects in individuals; providing first aid and treatment of injuries; reducing the probability of stochastic effects in the population; reduction of psychological impact on the population; and protection of the environment and property, all within the constraints of the available resources.</p>

<div class="menu-content plan">
<p><strong>National Disaster Management Plan</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The present government released the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP). This is the first ever national plan prepared in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The NDMP has been aligned broadly with the goals and priorities set out in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. &#39;</li>
    <li>The Vision of the Plan is to &quot;Make India disaster resilient, achieve substantial disaster risk reduction and significantly decrease the losses of life, livelihoods, and assets&mdash;economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental&mdash;by maximising the ability to cope with disasters at all levels of administration as well as among communities.</li>
    <li>For each hazard, the approach used in this national plan incorporates the four priorities enunciated in the Sendai Framework into the planning framework for Disaster Risk Reduction under the five Thematic Areas for Actions:</li> 
    &rarr;Understanding Risk
    <li>&rarr;Inter-Agency Coordination.Investing in DRR&mdash;Structural Measures</li>
    <li>&rarr;Investing in DRR&mdash;Non-Structural Measures</li>
    <li>&rarr;Capacity Development</li>
</ul>
<p>The Response part of the Plan has identified eighteen broad activities which have been arranged into a matrix to be served as a ready reckoner:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Early Warning, Maps, Satellite inputs, Information Dissemination</li>
    <li>Evacuation of People and AnimalsSearch and Rescue of People and Animalsa Medical Care</li>
    <li>Drinking Water/Dewatering. Pumps/Sanitation Facilities/Public Health Food and Essential Supplies</li>
    <li>Communication</li>
    <li>Housing and Temporary Shelters</li>
    <li>Power</li>
    <li>Fuel</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Relief Logistics and Supply Chain Management -a Disposal of Animal Carcasses</li>
    <li>Fodder for livestock in scarcity-hit areas</li>
    <li>Rehabilitation and Ensuring Safety of Livestock and other Animals, Veterinary Care</li>
    <li>Data Collection and Management</li>
    <li>Relief Employment</li>
</ul>
<p>The Plan has also incorporated a Chapter on Strengthening Disaster Risk Governance. The generalised responsibility matrix given in this section summarises the themes for strengthening Disaster Risk Governance and specifies agencies at the Centre and State with their respective roles. The matrix has six thematic areas in which Central and State Governments have to take actions to strengthen disaster risk governance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mainstream and integrate DRR and Institutional Strengthening</li>
    <li>Capacity Development</li>
    <li>Promote Participatory Approaches</li>
    <li>Work with Elected Representatives</li>
    <li>Grievance Redress Mechanism</li>
    <li>Promote Quality Standards, Certifications, and Awards for Disaster Risk Management</li>
    <li>The National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) provides a framework and direction to the government agencies for all phases of disaster management cycle.</li>
    <li>The NDMP is a dynamic document in the sense that it will be periodically improved keeping up with the emerging global best practices and knowledge bases in disaster management.</li>
    <li>Globally, the approach towards post-disaster restoration and rehabilitation has shifted to one of betterment reconstruction. The NDMP provides a generalised framework for recovery since it is not possible to anticipate all the possible elements of betterment reconstruction.</li>
    <li>The Plan also highlights that the disaster risk reduction will be achieved by mainstreaming the requirements into the developmental plans.</li>

<p><strong>Chemical Disasters and Biological Disasters</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Disasters: Prevention and Response .</strong></p>
<p>Chemical disasters may arise at any stage of the plant/process life cycle such as commissioning, storage, manufacturing, maintenance, disposal and transportation etc. The loss of contaminant of hazardous chemicals can lead to fire, explosions, toxic release or combination of them. At a time when the population density is high and more and more residential colonies are brewing up around the industries, a major mishap at a chemical plant can spill catastrophe to the people and environment. Besides fire and explosion hazard, the release of toxic chemicals can cause irreparable damage that can last long to people as well as to the environment. The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) is the nodal Ministry for the management of chemical disasters and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has prepared guidelines to direct ministries, department and state authorities for the preparation of disaster management plans. Since the Bhopal gas tragedy in 1984 there has been&#39; a paradigm shift in the government&#39;s approach to safety in industries from a reactive to proactive safety culture.</p>
<p><br></p></div>
  <div class="menu-content Biological"><p><strong>Causative factors</strong></p>
<p>Ageing of process plants and inadequate steps to pace with modern technologies in Indian chemical industry has increased vulnerability to chemical disasters. Fire, explosion, toxic release and combinations of all can occur during transport, storage and processing At to number of reasons such as temperature and pressure deviations from set limits, runaway reactions, mixing of incompatible materials, catastrophic rupture of reactors, storage vessels, pipelines,leaks, failure of hardware systems, inadequate mixing or agitation failures, improper design of reactor vents, inadequate process hazard analysis etc.</p>
<p>Organic solvents are the most common source of fires and explosions in the chemical industry. A majority of the industrial accidents occur due to human error as a result of non-compliance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPS) that have been put into place by the company.</p>
<p>Another common cause that results in chemical disaster is the improper maintenance of equipment. Regular maintenance at scheduled intervals following the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations is important for ensuring that the equipment runs smoothly and safely. When a piece of equipment is not properly maintained, it can malfunction and ultimately fail resulting in a catastrophic explosion.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention and Response</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Role of Industry: As far as chemical accidents are concerned, prevention is the best proactive approach rather than the reactive methods to chemical disasters. Each of the following stakeholders has a role and responsibility.</li>
    <ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Identification of hazardous activities:</strong> A good knowledge about the safety aspects of the industrial operations would enable the prevention and control of accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance of the plant facility and equipment:</strong> Proper maintenance of all the equipment and machinery need to be carried out at regular intervals. Regular site safety and health inspection needs to be carried out to ensure that the plant facility is safe and all the equipment&#39;s are operating in the intended method.</p>
<p>&mdash; <strong>Installation of vapour/gas detection system:</strong> Installation of gas/vapour detection system with alarms to detect leak even at micro levels would ensure that the leaks are attended at the early stages. Compliance with existing rules and regulations: Various rules and regulations of the state and centre should be strictly adhered for a sustainable and safe process.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Development of human resource management:</strong>Human resource management is complex and requires a constant monitoring and behaviour based safety program should be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&mdash;&gt; <strong>Emergency preparedness:</strong> The industry must have a good emergency response team that can react swiftly to mitigate propagating disasters.</p>
</ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Role of Government</li>
    <ul>
<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i><strong>Setting up of accident investigation board and chemical accident database:</strong> An accident investigation board in similar lines of chemical safety board of USA can be set up in India to investigate the. chemical disaster and bring out guidelines based on the lessons learnt in each incident would be helpful to prevent its reoccurrence.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i><strong>Awareness. Campaigns:</strong> The government can provide awareness regarding the hazards arising arise out a chemical disaster to the workers as well as the public.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i><strong>Research and development:&nbsp;</strong>initiative to newer technologies that can minimise the toxicity of the byproducts of chemical industries can be carried out by the government. Offsite Emergency Planning: The purpose of offsite emergency plan is to ensure that the local authority adequately discharges his duty to minitnize the consequences of major accident to people and environment in MAH located sites.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i><strong>Role of Public:</strong> A general awareness of the risk associated with any chemical accident would help in reducing the outcome of the accident. A mutual aid group can be setup to organise the general public in case of any disaster and provide training and awareness about the potential actions to be taken in case of any chemical leakage.</p>
</ul>
</ul>
  <div class="menu-content Plan"><p><strong>Biological Disasters: Causes and Way Forward&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Biological disasters define the devastating effects caused by an enormous spread of a certain kind of living organism&mdash;that may spread a disease, virus, or infestations of plant, animal or insect life on an epidemic or pandemic level. Cholera and influenza H1N I (Swine flu) outbreaks are examples of biological disasters. Epidemic-level biological disasters affect large numbers of people within a given community or area, whereas pandemic-level biological disasters effect a much larger region, sometimes spanning entire continents or the globe. Cholera is an epidemic level biological disaster, while swine flu is a pandemic. Other epidemic examples include ebola, dengue fever, malaria and the measles.</p>
<p>Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances or organic matters produced by parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi and protein that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source)</p>
<p>that can affect human health. It can also include substances harmful to other animals.</p>
