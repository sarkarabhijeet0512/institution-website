<h6>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</h6>
  

            Economic growth is related to a quantitative sustained increase in the country’s per capita output or income accompanied by expansion in its labour force, consumption, capital and volume of trade. On the other hand, economic development is a wider concept than economic growth. It is related to qualitative changes in economic wants, goods, incentives, institutions, productivity and knowledge or the “upward movement of the entire social system”. It describes the underlying determinants of growth such as technological and structural changes. In fact, economic development embraces both growth such as technological and structural changes. In fact, economic development embraces both growth and decline. An economy can grow but it may not develop because poverty, unemployment and inequalities may continue to persist due to the absence of technological and structural changes. But it is difficult to imagine development without economic growth.

        <br><br>
            
<h6>MEASUREMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:</h6>

<ul>

<li><b>GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT:</b> One of the methods to measure economic development is in terms of an increase in the economy’s real national income over a long period of time. But this is not a satisfactory definition due to the following reasons:</li>

<p>f final goods and services in real terms rather than in money terms. Thus price changes will have to be ruled out while calculating real national income. But this is unrealistic because variations in prices are inevitable.</p>

<p>&rarr; This measure fails to take into consideration changes in the growth of population. If a rise in real national income is accompanied by a faster growth in population there will be no economic growth but retardation.</p>

<p>&rarr; The gross National Product (GNP) figure also does not reveal the costs incurred by the society on account of environmental pollution, urbanisation, industrialisation and population growth, It considers natural resources to be free and treats the earth “like a business in liquidation”.</p>

<p>&rarr; Further, it tells us nothing about the distribution of income in the economy.</p>


<li><b>GNP PER CAPITA:</b> The second measure relates to an increase in the per capita real income of the economy over the long period. This indicator of economic growth purports to emphasise that for economic development the rate of increase in real per capita income should be higher than the growth rate of population. But difficulties still remain.</li>

  <p>&rarr;An increase in per capita income may not raise the real standard of living of the masses. It is possible that while per capita real income is increasing, per capita consumption might be falling.</p>

   <p>&rarr;There is another possibility of the masses remaining poor despite an increase in the real GNP per capita if the increased income goes to the few rich instead of going to the many poor.</p>

   <p>&rarr;The real GNP per capita fails to take into account problems associated with basic needs like nutrition, health, sanitation, housing, water and education. The improvement in living standards by providing basic needs cannot be measured by increase in GNP per capita.</p>
 

Despite these limitation, the real GNP per capita is the most widely used measure of economic development.

<li><b>WELFARE:</b> There is also a tendency to measure economic development from the point of view of economic welfare. Economic development is regarded as a process whereby there is an increase in the consumption of goods and services of individuals. This indicator is also not free from limitations.</li>

<li><b>SOCIAL INDICATORS:</b> Dissatisfied with GNP per capita as the measure of economic development, certain economists have tried to measure it in terms of social indicators. Economists include a wide variety of items in social indicators. Some are inputs such as improvements in health in terms of infant mortality rates, sickness rates, etc. Social indicators are often referred to as the basic needs for development. Basic needs focus on alleviation of poverty by providing basic human needs to the poor.
<br>
The merit of social indicators is that they are concerned with ends, being human development. Economic development is a means to these ends. Social indicators tell us how different countries prefer to allocate the GNP among alternatives. Some may prefer to spend more on education and less on hospitals. Moreover, they give an idea about the presence, absence or deficiency of certain basic needs.</li>
</ul>

<b>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX</b>

      Mahbub-ul-Haq and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen invented the Human Development Index and UNDP incorporated it into it first Human Development Report in 1990.
<b>ABOUT HDI</b>
<ul>
       <li> The HDI was created to emphasise the people and their capabilities should be the ultimate carrier for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.</li>

        <li>The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes.</li>

        <li>These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.</li>

        <li>The HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living.</li>

        <li>The HDI is the geometric mean of normalised indices for each of the three dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<b>COMPONENTS OF HDI</b>
  <ul>
       The index is based on three dimensions:
<br>
       <li> Life expectancy at birth.</li>

        <li>Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling, and Gross.</li>

        <li>national income per capita</li>
</ul>

<h6>INCLUSIVE GROWTH DEFINITION</h6>

            Inclusive growth refers both to the pace and pattern of growth, which is considered interlinked and therefore in need to be addressed together. Inclusiveness- a concept that encompasses equality, equality of opportunity and protection in market and employment transactions- is an essential ingredient of any successful growth strategy.
            <br>
            The inclusive growth approach takes a longer term perspective as the focus is on productive employment rather than direct income redistribution, as a means of increasing incomes for excluded groups. In the short run, governments could use income distribution schemes to attenuate negative impacts on the poor of policies intended to jump start growth, but transfer schemes cannot be an answer in the long run and can be problematic also in the short run. In poor countries such schemes can impose significant burdens on already stretched budgets and it is theoretically impossible to reduce poverty through redistribution in countries where average income falls below US$ 700 per year. Even in developed countries, redistribution schemes cannot be the only response to rising poverty rates in certain segments of the population.

<h6>FINACNIAL INCLUSION</h6>

            Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs- transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance- delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.

<h6>INITIATIVES FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN INDIA</h6>
<ul>
    <li>        The broad strategy for financial inclusion in India in recent years comprises the following elements.</li>

        <li>Encouraging penetration into unbanked and backward areas and encouraging agents and intermediaries such as NGOs, CSOs and Business Correspondents (BCs);</li>

        <li>Focusing on a decentralised strategy by using existing arrangements such a State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) and District Consultative Committee (DCC) and strengthening local institutions such as cooperatives and RRBs.</li>

       <li> Using technology for furthering financial inclusion;</li>

        <li>Advising banks to open a basic banking no frills’ accounts;</li>

        <li>Emphasis on financial literacy and credit counselling; and

        Creating synergies between the formal and informal segments.</li>

  <div class="menu-content national-income"><h3>NATIONAL INCOME</h3><hr>
    <h6>Introduction</h6>

            National income is defined as the value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country, whether operating within the domestic territory of the country, or outside, in a year. National income is thus, a momentary expression of the current achievements of they people of expression of the current achievements of the people of a country expressed through their production activities.

            <b>National product is stock and quantitative concept.</b><br>

                        <b>National Product=Price * Quantity</b><br>

                                                   <b>NP= PQ</b><br>

            National income is the sum of return of all the resources involved in any economic activities. It is qualitative and dynamic concept and related to flow.

            <b>National income = Wage + Rent + Interest + Profit</b><br>

            National income can be defined in many ways. In simplest terms, it can be described as the income of all the people of a country during a year.<br>

            It is also defined as the money value of all the final goods and services product in an economy over a specified period of time. It indicates the performance of an economy in terms of production of goods and services. It is used as a measure of economic growth and reflects the productive power of an economy to turn out goods and services for the satisfaction of human wants.<br>

            <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</b> GDP is monetary value of final goods and services which are produced by general residents of country in own physical boundary.<br>

            <b>GDP = C + I + G</b><br>

            <b>Here, c = Consumption, I = Investment</b><br>

            <b>G = Government Expenditure</b><br>

            <b>Net Domestic Product (NDP): It is the difference between GDP and depreciation.</b><br>

            <b>NDP = GDP – Depreciation, NDP = C + I + G – D</b><br>

            <b>Depreciation:</b> It refers to the reduction in the value of capital assets, (e.g. machinery building, equipment, etc). Due to normal wear and tear and technological obsolescence. Depreciation is also called consumption of fixed capital and capital consumption. Net value is obtained by reducing the values of depreciation from the value.<br>

            <b>Net value = Gross value – Depreciation</b>

            <b>Gross National Product (GNP):</b> GNP is the sum of values of all final goods and services which is produced by citizen of a country in financial year and net earned income from abroad.<br>

            <b>GNP = C + I + G + (X-M)</b><br>

            <b>X – Income earned from export, M – Income expenses on import</b><br>

            <b>Basic difference in GDP and GNP:</b> In case of GDP of net income earned from abroad excluded but in case of GNP it is included. In India only two years 1972-73 and 1976-77 GNP was more than GDP. These two years are to be called golden years of Indian economy.<br>

            <b>Net National Product (NNP):</b> It is difference between GNP and Depreciation.<br>

<b>NNP = GNP – Depreciation</b>
<br><br>
<b>Real income:</b> Real income is national income expressed in terms of general level of prices of a particular year taken as base. National income is the value of goods and services produced as expressed in terms of money at current prices. But it does not indicate the real state of the economy. It is possible that the net national product of goods and services this year might have been less than that of the last year, but owing to an increase in prices, the NNP might be higher this year. On the contrary, it is also possible that NNP might have increased but the price level might have fallen, as a result of which national income would appear to be less than that of the last year. In both the situations, the national income does not depict the real state of the country. To rectify such as a mistake, the concept of real income has been evolved.<br>

            Factor Cost versus Market Price: Factor cost (FC) refers to the payments made to the factors of production (i.e. labour, land, capital, and entrepreneurship) of goods and services, while Market Price (MP) refers to the market value of the goods and services produced. Market price of the goods and services is arrived at by adding Net Indirect Taxes (i.e. Indirect Taxes – Subsidies) in the cost of production (FC).<br>

            <b>MP = FC +== Net Indirect Taxes</b><br>

            <b>e.g. GDP (MP) = GDP (FC) + Indirect taxes – Subsidies</b><br>

            <b>or, GNP MP = GNP FC + Indirect Taxes – Subsidies</b><br>

            Current Price versus Constant Price: National income at current prices shows the value of the goods and services at the market prices prevailing in the current year (i.e. the same year in which they were produced), while national income at constant prices shows the value of the goods and services at the base year (1993-94) prices. National income at current prices is called ‘Nominal national Income’ while national income at constant prices is called Real National Income, as it offers the effects of inflation.<br>

            <b>Deflation of GDP:</b> Conversion of Nominal GDP into Real GDP by adjusting it for price level changes is called deflation of GDP<br>

<b>Real GDP Constant Price = GDP Current prices * 100/Price Index Number</b><br>

            For example, the value of nominal GDP was 28.38 lakh, crore in the financial year 2004-05 and the (mid-year) value of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 185.57, then the value of Real GDP can be calculated as follows:<br><br>

<b>Real GDP = 28.38 lakh crore * 100 /185.57 = 15.29 lakh crore</b><br><br>

            <b>Capital Output Ratio:</b> The required capital for production of one unit is called capital output ratio.<br><br>

            <b>Capital Output Rato = Total capital / Total production</b><br><br>

           <b> C.O.R = Total capital/ Total Production</b><br><br>

            <b>Average Capital Output Ratio (A.C.O.R)</b><br><br>

            <b>Incremental Capital Output Ratio (I.C.O.R)</b><br><br>

            I.C.O.R = Increase in capital / Increase in production
            <br>
            <br>

<b>Methods of Calculating National Income</b>
<ul>
    <li>        Three methods are usually adopted to calculate national income.</li>

       <li><b> The Income Method:</b> This method measures national income at the stage of factor payments made to primary factor for the use of their factor services.
<br>
National Income = Compensation of employees + capital incomes on operating surplus + mixed incomes + net factor income from abroad.</li>

        <li><b>The Product Method or the Inventory Method:</b> It takes into consideration the total goods and services consumed in a year at market prices. This method needs an accurate census of production as well as wages census.</li>

        <li><b>Expenditure Method:</b> From the expenditure viewpoint, national income is the sum total of expenditure incurred on goods and services during one year in a country. It includes private consumption expenditure (C), domestic private invest (I), net foreign investment (X-M) and government expenditure (G).
<br>
National Income = C + I + G + (X-M) = GNP</li>


 </ul>


<b>National Income Aggregates</b>
<ul>

       <li><b> Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices (GDPmp):</b>GDP at market prices is the value of all fixed goods and services at prices prevailing in the market produced in the domestic territory of a country during a given year. Being gross, it is inclusive of depreciation, i.e. consumption of fixed capital in the process of production has not been excluded.</li>

       <li><b> Gross National Product at Market Prices (GNPmp):</b> It is defined as the aggregate market value of all final goods and services produced by national of a country during a year. It differs from GDPMP to the extent of net factor incomes earned from abroad. To get GNPmp from GDPmp, we have to add to GDPmp the income earned from abroad by the residents of country in the forms of wages, interests and profits.</li>

<b>GNPmp = GDPmp + Net Factor income from abroad</b>

       <li><b> Net Domestic Product at Market Prices (NDPmp):</b> Net domestic product at market prices is the value of all final goods and services at prices prevailing in the market produced in the domestic territory of a country during a given year after making allowance from depreciation.</li>

<b>Net Domestic Product at market prices is the difference between gross domestic product at market prices and depreciation.</b>
<br>
NDPmp = GDPmp - Depreciation
<br>
NDPmp is the measure of national income which is available for consumption and investment in the economy.
<br>
       <li><b>Net National Product at Market Prices (NNPmp):</b> Net National Product at market prices is similar to NDPmp. It shows the market value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country during a year after making allowance for depreciation. It differs from GNPmp in that the depreciation of capital is subtracted.
<br>
NNPmp = GNPmp – Depreciation
<br>
It is considered to be more accurate measure of  the true output of the economy than GNPmp.</li>

       <li> <b>Gross Domestic Product at Factor Cost (GDPfc):</b> It is the sum total of earnings received by various factors of production in terms of wages, interest, rent, profits etc. Within the domestic territory of a country in a year. If we deduct net indirect taxes from Gross Domestic Product at market prices, we get gross domestic product at factor cost. Being gross, it makes no provision for the depreciation.
<br>
GDPfc = GDPmp – Net Indirect Taxes</li>

       <li> <b>Gross National Product at Factor Cost (GNPfc):</b> It is the sum total of earnings received by various factors of production in terms of wages, rent, interest etc. By normal residents of a country in a year. It differs from GNPmp to the extent of net indirect taxes.
<br>
GNPfc = GNPmp – Net Indirect taxes</li>

       <li> <b>Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost (NDPfc):</b> Net Domestic Product at factor cost is the estimate of the domestic product in terms of earnings of factors of production within the domestic territory of a country in a year. It differs from gross domestic product at factor cost to the extent of depreciation.
<br>
NDPfc = GDPfc – Depreciation</li>

       <li> <b>Net National Product at Factor Cost (NNPfc) or National Income:</b> National income can be defined as factor incomes accruing to the residents of a country. It is the sum total of domestic factor income and net factor incomes earned from abroad.
<br>
NNPfc (or National Income) = domestic Factor Incomes + Net Factor Income earned From Abroad NNPfc = GNPfc – Depreciation
<br>
National income can also be found out by deducting depreciation from gross product at factor cost.
<br>
New Series Estimates of National income, Consumption Expenditure, Saving and Capital Formation (Base Year 2011-12)</li>

       <li> The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation has released the new series of national accounts, revising the base year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 base year of national accounts was last revised in January 2010.</li>

       <li> Base year revisions differ from annual revisions in National Account primarily because of nature of changes. In annual revisions, changes are made only on the basis of updated data becoming available without making any changes in the conceptual framework or using any new data source, to ensure strict comparison over years. In case of base years revisions, apart from a shift in the reference year for measuring the real growth, conceptual changes, as recommended by the international guidelines are incorporated. Further, statistical changes like revisions, in the methodology of compilation, adoption of latest classification systems and inclusion of new and recent data sources are also made. Changes are also made in the presentation of estimates to improve ease of understanding for analysis and facilitate international comparability.</li>

        <li> Improvements as noted above, especially incorporation of new datasets, have resulted in a correction in the level of GDP, which is likely to affect a wide range of indicators where it is used as a reference point: for instance, trends in public expenditure, taxes and public sector debt that are conventionally analysed in terms of their ratios to nominal GDP. It may be noted that the level of revision in the present base revision is not large enough to affect any of these ratios significantly.

<b>Meaning of Economic Planning</b>
<br>

            Economic Planning means the allocation of limited resources among different uses in such a way as to bring about the maximum welfare of the people. Economic planning consists of two basic elements. One is the determination of objectives and second is the provision of means for the achievement of those objectives. The detailed scheme is called economic Plan. The planning may either be centralised or decentralised depending upon the national requirements and degree of involvement of different sectors. The centralised planning refers to complete central control over major parts of the economic activities. Some of the decisions are related to investment in different sectors of economy, fixation of price structure, rate of wages and the amount of production of a particular commodity.
            <br>
<b>Types of Planning:</b>

            Planning can be categorised into various categories on the basis of the following.<br>

<b>Role of the Government:</b><br>
<ul>
        <li>Imperative Planning: It is also known as directive/totalitarian/authoritarian planning or planning by direction command. Under imperative planning, the central planning authority decides about each and every aspect of the economy. The target sets the processes delineated to achieve them are to be strictly followed. This type of planning is generally practiced in the socialist economies.</li>

        <li>Planning by inducement: Under such kind of planning, state regulates the private sector through the use of various incentives and disincentives (i.e. fiscal, monetary and industrial policy measures), so that the private sector may cooperate in fulfilling the targets and priorities of the plan. This kind of planning is generally practices in mixed economies.</li>

       <li> Indicative planning: It is also known as soft or facilitatory planning. Under it, state sets broad parameters and goals for the economy and endeavours to achieve them through persuasion and facilitation. The state provides all types of facilitates to the private sector and indicates the areas in which it can help in implementing the plan. It is based on French model of planning and generally practiced in capitalistic economics. It has been pursued in India since the Eight Five Year Plan.</li>
</ul>
<b>Extent of People’s Participation</b>
<ul>
       <li> Centralised planning: Under centralised planning there is a central planning authority which formulates the plan, fix objectives, target and priorities for every sector of the economy. There is a central control and all economic activities are directed in accordance with a single plan.</li>

        <li>Decentralised planning: It is also known as democratic planning, planning from below and grass root planning. A decentralised plan is characterised by the widest possible consultations with the various state governments and the private sector at the stage of formulation and implementation of the plan. The central plan incorporates plans under the central schemes and plans for the states as well as the district and village level plans.</li>
</ul>
<b>Economic systems:</b>

            The nature and scope of planning is largely determined by the nature of the economic system in which it is practices. Economies can be classified into the following categories:
            <ul>
       <li> <b>Socialist economy:</b> It is characterised by the existence of public enterprise or state ownership of capital in all the important spheres of the economic activity. All important economic decisions are undertaken by the planning authority. Such economies generally pursue planning by direction or imperative planning.</li>

        <li><b>Capitalistic economy:</b> It is characterised by the existence of private enterprise and ownership of all important means of production. Resources are allocated by the operation of the price mechanism by which buyers and sellers determine what goods and services will be bought and sold in the market, in what quantities and what prices. Such economies generally pursue indicative planning, as the role of planning authority and government is minimal.</li>

        <li><b>Mixed economy:</b> It is characterised by the presence of the features of socialism as well as that of capitalism i.e., public sector co-exist with the private sector-Resources are allocated on the basis of demand and supply with selective government intervention. Such economic generally pursue planning by inducement i.e., government regulate the activities of the private sector through persuasive measures like tax holidays, subsidies etc.</li>

        <li><b>Community economy:</b> It is an extreme form of a socialist economy in which all means of production are owned and operated by the state and private property is not allowed. It is modelled after the notion of Karl marx i.e., “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”. Socialism is said to be the preparatory but it has not yet established in any of the socialist country.</li>
</ul>

<b>Features of Indian Planning:</b><br>

            The important characteristics of the economic planning in India are as follows:
<ul>
       <li> Indicated Planning: Indian planning has assumed indicative character since the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97).</li>

&rarr; <b> Core Plan:</b> The concept of core plan enables the planning authority in formulating effective plans through realistic assessment of the resources. Under a core plan, the Planning Commission determines the expenditure head of state annual plans.<br>

&rarr; <b>Democratic socialism:</b> It connotes to the adoption of the principle of socialism (i.e., classless society) within a democratic (i.e., ensuring individual liberty) framework. It was Nehru’s vision of independent India in which all have equal opportunities in education, health, employment etc.<br>

&rarr; <b> Socialistic pattern of society:</b> It connotes to such a mixed economic system in which there are no economic and social inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth in a country. State owned means of production are used to promote social welfare and privately owned means of production are effectively regulated by the state through various instruments on the economic policy. It was adopted as one of the goals of the economic planning in India in the Second Five Year Plan.<br>

       <li><b> Decentralised and democratic planning:</b> People are involved at various stages of preparation and implementation of the plans.</li>

        <li><b>Comprehensive planning:</b> Planning process encompasses each and every sector of the Indian economy.</li>

        <li><b>Physical and financial planning:</b> Resources are assessed and allocated in both real and monetary terms.</li>

        <li><b>Perspective planning:</b> The five-year plans sets objectives and targets beyond the plan period, e.g. the 10th plan sets certain targets to be accomplished by 2012.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content economic-reforms"><h3>ECONOMIC REFORMS</h3><hr>

            The entire period of economic planning in India can be divided into two different phases- the first phase spreading over the plan period from1950-51 to 1990, while the second phase commences from 1991. The first phase laid down the basic objectives and strategies of development while the second phase showed a significant shift in the original objectives and strategies of planning leading to economic reforms.
            <br><br>
<b>First Generation Reforms:</b>

            The Economic Reforms of 1991 or the New Economic Policy is a complete reversal of the previous policies. These economic reforms were based on three premises Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG). These reforms seek to free the Indian economy from undue controls, give greater freedom to the more efficient private sector and integrate the Indian economy with the world economy. These reforms aimed at putting an end to the government’s Licence, Quota and Permit (LOP) raj by initiating the LPG mantra.
            <br><br>

            <b>Economic liberalisation:</b> It implies providing greater freedom to economic agents to take their own economic decisions. It generally means leaving the economy to free market forces with least government interference.
            <br><br>

<b>Salient Features of the New Economic Policy:</b>


            The economic reforms (First Generation Reforms) introduced the following policy changes:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Delicensing:</b> Industrial licensing system has been abolished for most of the industries.</li>

            <li><b>Dereservation:</b> the industries which were exclusively reserved for the public sector were deserved expect for a few.</li>

            <li><b>Deregulation:</b> The industries laws like Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act were amended to ease restrictions on economic units.</li>

           <li><b> Disinvestment:</b> The government proposed to sell the government equity (share capital) in certain Public Sector Units (PSUs) to the private sector.</li>

            <li><b>Easing of trade barriers:</b> The restrictions on imports and exports were removed and tariffs were lowered.</li>

            <li><b>Encouragement to foreign capital and technology:</b> Restriction on the operations of the Multinational Corporations (MNCs) were removed and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was relaxed to allow free inflow of foreign investments.</li>

            <li><b>Taxation reforms:</b> The tax rates and tax slabs were rationalised, taxation system was simplified and the loopholes in the administration were plugged.</li>

            <li><b>Fiscal reforms:</b> The government proposed to reduce the non-plan expenditure in order to reduce budgetary deficits.</li>

            <li><b>Banking reforms:</b> The interest structure was deregulated and greater autonomy was provided to the banks.</li>
</ul>
<b>Second Generation Reforms:</b>
<br>

            Economic reforms programme that began under the Rao-Manmohan Model of the economic reforms in 1991 aimed at delicencing and decontrolling vital sectors of the economy. It involved abolishing industrial licensing, opening of trade, disinvestment and privatisation, tax reforms, private financing infrastructure like power and telecom, etc. The 1991 policy had two parts: firstly to extricate the economy out of the deep macroeconomic crisis by undertaking ‘stabilisation measures’ and secondly to bring about certain structural changes’ in the economy. The first step was mainly a short-term measure while the second was generally of the nature of medium to long-term and designed to free the supply side of the economy.
            <br><br>
            These reforms have, however, left the factor markets such as labour market, capital market, natural resources etc. mostly untouched. The aim of the second generation reforms is to bring reform into these areas. The name, ‘second generation’ does not imply that we have successfully completed the first generation of reforms and should move to the next higher level.
            <br><br>
            In fact, the two generations of reforms are overlapping. Such reforms are complementary as well as supplementary to the First Generation Reforms. So the second generation reforms have two dimension, i.e. to carry forward first generation reforms and to initiate reforms in new areas.
            <br>
<b>Carry Forward First Generation Reforms</b>
<ul>
     <li><b>Banking sector reforms:</b> Such reforms should extended to encompass the entire financial sector. Reforms should be initiated in money and capital markets in the form of dematerialisation, corporation and demutualisation of stock exchanges.</li>

        <li><b>Taxation in Free India:</b> CENVAT should be converted into full-fledged VAT. Reforms should also be extended to the fiscal policy like reduction of the public expenditure borrowing, downsizing government staff etc.</li>
</ul>
<b>Planning in Free India</b>
<br>

           <p> The Planning Commission was set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in March 1950 in pursuance of declared objectives of the Government to promote a rapid rise in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of the country, increasing production and offering opportunities to all for employment in the services of the community.</p>

           <p> The Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility of making assessment of all resources of the country, augmenting deficient resources, formulating plans for the most effective and balanced utilisation of resources and determining priorities. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Chairman of the Planning Commission.</p>

           <p> The first five year plan was launched in 1951 and two subsequent five-year plans were formulated till 1965, when there was a break because of the Indo-Pakistan conflict. Two successive years of drought, devaluation of the currency, a general rise in prices and erosion of resources disrupted the planning process and after three Annual Plans between 1966 and 1969, the fourth five-year plan was started in 1969.</p>

           <p> The eighth plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing political situation at the centre and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were treated as Annual Plans. The eight plan was finally launched in 1992 after the initiation of structural adjustment policies.</p>

           <p> For the first eight plans the emphasis was on a growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries, but since the launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997, the emphasis on the public sector has become less pronounced and the current thinking on planning in the country, in general, is that it should increasingly be of an indicative nature.</p>
         </div>
  <div class="menu-content planning-commission"><h3>PLANNING COMMISSION</h3><hr>

            The defunct Planning Commission was an extra-constitutional and non-statutory body set up on 15th March, 1950 by a government resolution. It was constituted as an advisory body to the Union Government for the formulation of plans. The main function of the Commission was to estimate the resources and to prepare a plan for the most effective and balanced utilisation of the country’s resources. It was replaced by NITI Aayog in 2014.<br><br>


<b>Goals of Planning</b><br>

            Planning in India derives its objectives from the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the constitution. Goals and objectives of planning can be summarised into two categories, i.e. short-term and long-term goals. Short-term goals of a plan refers to the immediate and most important targets which a particular plan endeavours to achieve. Such goals are called focus of plan as they reflect the strategy of a particular plan. On the other hand, long-term objectives of planning are the general guiding principles of the planning process and reflects the aspirations of a welfare state. The long-term objectives of planning in India have been more or less same in almost all the five-year plans and are as follows:
<ul>

        <li>To accelerate the pace of economic growth in order to raise the standard of living of the people. That is to achieve higher levels of national income and per capita income.</li>

        <li>To achieve self-reliance in respect of the production of food grains, development of basic industries, technological know-how and foreign exchange earnings. It aims to eliminate vulnerability of the Indian economy to international pressures and disturbances.</li>

        <li>To ensure social justice to the people by eliminating poverty, unemployment and inequalities of income and wealth.</li>

        <li>To modernise the economy by bringing about structural and institutional changes in the framework of economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Self-sufficiency and Self-reliance:</b>

            Self-sufficiency implies that a country produces all commodities it requires within the country without having to import them, while self-reliance implies that a country has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to pay for its imports.<br>


<b>Growth Strategies</b>
<br>
<ul>


            <li><b>Balanced growth strategy:</b> It was advocated by R. Rodan, Nurkse and Lewis. It states that there should be simultaneous and harmonious development of different sectors of the economy, so that all sectors grow in unison.</li>

            <li><b>Unbalanced growth strategy:</b> It was advocated by Streeten, Singer and Hirschman, It states that investment should be made in selected sectors rather than simultaneously in all sectors. It is based on the premise that underdeveloped countries posses limited resources which should be invested in high priority sectors.
            </li>
          </ul></div>

  <div class="menu-content niti-aayog"><h3>NITI Aayog</h3><hr>

            The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, was formed via a resolution of the Union Cabinet on January 1, 2015. NITI Aayog is the premier policy “Think Tank” of the Government of India, providing both directional and policy inputs. While designing strategic and long-term policies and programmes for the Government of India, NITI Aayog also provides relevant technical advice to the Centre and States.
            <br><br>
            The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI Aayog to replace the planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to better serve the need and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quientessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism.
            <br><br>
            At the core of NITI Aayoga’s creation are two hubs-Team India Hub and the Knowledge and Innovation Hub. The Team India Hub leads the engagement of states with the Central government, while the Knowledge and Innovation Hub builds NITI’s think-tank capabilities. These hubs reflect the two key tasks of the Aayog.
            <br>

<b>NITI Aayoga is based on 7 Pillars of Effective Governance</b>
<ul>

   <li>     Pro-people fulfils the aspirations of the society as well as individuals.</li>

       <li> Pro-active in anticipation and response to citizen needs.</li>

       <li> Participation involvement of citizens.</li>

        <li>Empowering women in all aspects.</li>

        <li>Inclusion of all groups, with special attention to the economically weak (garib), the SC, St and OBC communities, the rural sector and farmers (gaon and kisan), youth and all categories of minorities.</li>

        <li>Equality of opportunity to our country’s youth.</li>

        <li>Transparency through the use of technology to make government visible and responsive

  <div class="menu-content agriculture"><h3>AGRICULTURE IN INDIA</h3><hr>

            The majority of the total population in India is living in rural areas. Agriculture is considered as the only source of primary occupation as a huge size of rural population of the country is solely dependent on agriculture. Thus the development of rural areas should receive top priority in our development programmes. Accordingly, it requires development of agriculture, implementation of land reform measures and development of cooperatives.
<br><br>
<b>Plantation Crops</b>
<br>
<ul>

       <li><b> Tea: </b> India is second largest producer after China and largest consumer of tea in the world and accounts for about 27% of world production and 13% of the world trade. Export of tea is around 20% of domestic production.</li>

        <li><b>Coffee:</b> Although India contributes only 4% of the world production, Indian coffee has created a niche for itself in the international market, particularly Indian Robustas, which is highly preferred for their good blending quality. Arabica coffee from India is also well received in the international market.</li>

        <li><b>Natural rubber:</b> Rubber is primarily produced in the state of Kerala and adjoining Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, the traditional rubber growing areas of the country. Rubber is also produced in Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Goa and coastal Karnataka.</li>
</ul>
<b>Horticulture:</b>

            The country’s horticulture production rose by 5 percent to touch an all-time high of 300 million tonnes during 2016-17 on the back of record output of record output of fruits, vegetables, spices and plantation crops.
            <br><br>
            According to government data, area under horticulture crops increased by 2.6 percent to 25.1 million hectares in 2016-17, up 3.9 percent from the previous year.
            <br><br>
            A Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture in North-Eastern region including Sikkim was approved with an outlay of 229.38crore for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. The implementation of the scheme has been extended to the States of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the Tenth plan with an additional outlay of 260.00 crore. The scheme aims at establishing convergence and synergy among numerous ongoing governmental programmes through horizontal and vertical integration of these programmes, to ensure adequate, appropriate, timely and concurrent attention to all the links in the production, post-harvest and consumption chain. During 2006-07, an amount of 157.50 crore was released, out of which 81.86 crore was for NE States and 75.63 crore for Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
<br><br>
<b>National Horticulture Mission:</b>

            The Department of agriculture and Cooperation has launched a Centrally-sponsered scheme called National Horticulture Mission (NHM) during 2005-06 for holistic development of this sector ensuring horizontal and vertical linkages with the active participation of all the stakeholders. The Mission’s objectives are: enhance horticulture production through area-based regionally differentiated strategies: improve nutritional security and income support to farm households; establish convergence and synergy among ongoing programmes for horticulture development; and, promote, develop and disseminate technologies.
          
          

</div>
  <div class="menu-content food"><h3>FOOD MANAGEMENT IN INDIA</h3><hr>


            <b>Food management in India has three basic objectives:</b>
            <ul>

        <li>Procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices,</li>

        <li>Distribution of food grains to the consumers particularly the vulnerable sections of the society at affordable prices, and</li>

       <li> Maintenance of food buffers for food security and price stability. The instruments for food management are the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Central Issue Price (CIP).</li>
</ul>
The focus is on incentivising farmers by ensuring fair value for their produce through minimum support price mechanism, distribution of food grains at subsidised rates to 6.52 crore BPL families covering all household under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), establishing grain banks in chronically food scarce areas and strengthening the Public Distribution System (PDS). The nodal agency which undertakes the procurement and distribution and storage of food grains is the Food Corporation of India (FCI).
<br>
The procurement under the current system is open-ended at MSP, while the distribution is governed by the scale of allocation and its off take by the beneficiaries.
<br>
The scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) is in operation since 1997, under which food grains are procured and distributed by the State Governments themselves. Under this scheme, the designated States procure, store and also issue food grains under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). The difference between the economic cost of the State Government and the Central Issue Price is passed on to the state Government as subsidy. The decentralised system of procurement helps to cover more farmers under the MSP operations, improves efficiency of the PDS, provides food grain varieties more suited to local taste and reduces the transportation costs of the FCI.
<br>

<b>Food stocks are maintained by the Central Government for the purposes:</b>
<br>
<ul>
        <li>Meeting the prescribed minimum buffer stock norms for food security.</li>

        <li>For monthly release of food grains for supply through PDS (Public Distribution System).</li>

        <li>For market intervention to augment supply so as to help moderate the open market prices.</li>
</ul>
<b>National Food Security Mission:</b>

            The Department of agriculture and cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, has launched a Centrally sponsored scheme on National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in pursuance of the resolution of the National Development Council (NDC) to increase the production of rice, wheat and pulses by 10, 8 and 2 million tonnes, respectively, over the benchmark levels of production, by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year plan period. The Mission, which has been launched from Rabi 2007-08, aims at increasing food grains production of the above crops through area expansion and productivity; creating employment opportunity; and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers of targeted districts.
<br>
Various activities of NFSM relate to demonstration of improved production technology, distribution of quality seeds of HYVs and hybrids, popularisation of newly released varieties, support for micronutrients, and training and mass media campaign including awards for best performing districts. The identified districts are given flexibility to adopt any local area specific intervention as are included in the Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) prepared for the agriculture development of the district. 2 crore each will be provided during the Eleventh Five-Year plan period to those districts which have a programme for any one of crops. The mission covers 312 districts in 17 states and has become operational from Rabi 2007-08. Under the NFSM, initial reports indicate an increase in wheat seed distribution from 43% in Rajsthan to as high as 10 times in Bihar. In pulses also, the increase in use of improved seed range from 29% in Rajsthan to more than 400% in Chhatishgarh. Focused and target oriented technological intervention under NFSM has made significant impact since to inception, reflected in the increase in production of rice and wheat in 2008-09.<br>

<b>Major Producing States</b>
<ul>
        <li><b>Food grains:</b> Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal</li>

        <li><b>Wheat:</b> Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Rice:</b> West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Coarse Cereals:</b> Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajsthan and Uttar Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Pulses:</b> Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajsthan</li>
</ul>
<b>Commercial Crops</b><br>

            Commercial Crops are those crops which are produced for trade purpose and earning money and not for self-consumption by the farmers. These commercial crops include:
            <ul>
        <li><b>Oilseed crops:</b> Groundnut, Mustard, Sesame, Rapeseed, Linseed, Castor, Sunflowers, Niger seed and Soybean.</li>

        <li><b>Sugar crops:</b> Sugarcane and Beat</li>

        <li><b>Fibre crops:</b> Jute, Mesta, Sunhemp and Cotton</li>

        <li><b>Narcotic crop:</b> Tobacco</li>
        <li><b>Beverage crops:</b> Tea, Coffee</li>
      </ul>
<b>TRIFED:</b>

            The Government established TRIFED (Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd.) in August 1987, The basic aim of TRIFED was to save tribals from exploitation by private traders and to offer them remunerative prices for their minor forest produce and surplus agriculture products. TRIFED started functioning since April 1988. TRIFED has also been declared an important agency for collecting, processing, storing and developing of oil seed products. TRIFED plays a role of an agent of FCI for Government purchase of wheat and rice. It is also an agent of agriculture and cooperation department for Government purchase of cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Agriculture Ministry gives aid to TRIFED for compensating loss incurred due to price fluctuations.<br>

<b>NAFED:</b>

            NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd.) has been established in cooperative sector at national level for marketing of agriculture products.
            Agricultural Marketing<br>

            Organised marketing of agricultural commodities has been promoted in the country through a network of regulated markets. Most of the State Governments and Union Territories have enacted legislation (APMC Act) to provide for regulation of agriculture produce markets. While by the end of 1950, there were 286 regulated markets in the country, but as on March 31, 2009 the number stands at 7,139. Besides the country has 20,868 rural periodical markets, about 15% of which function under the ambit of regulation. The advent of regulated markets has helped in mitigating the market handicaps of producers/sellers at the wholesale assembling level. But, the rural periodic markets in general, and the tribal markets in particular, remained out of the development ambit of APMC Act.
            <br>
            Agriculture sector needs well functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural areas of the country. In order to inject dynamism and efficiency into the marketing system, large investments are required for the development of post-harvest and cold chain infrastructure nearer to the farmer’s field. A major portion of this investment is expected from the private sector, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment is necessary. Alongside, enabling policies need to be put in place to encourage procurement of agricultural commodities directly from farmers’ field and to establish effective linkage between the farm production and the retail chain and food processing industries. Accordingly, amendment to the State APMC Act for deregulation of marketing system in the country is suggested to promote investment in marketing infrastructure, motivating corporate sector to undertake direct marketing and to facilitate a national integrated market.
            <br>

<b>Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act:</b>

            The Government of India has circulated model legislation titled “The State Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) act, 2003 to bring about reforms in agricultural marketing contract farming, direct marketing and public-private partnership in management and development of agricultural markets are the major instruments of change among others.

            Twenty-five States/UTs have already amended their Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts and made varying provisions for the purpose while the remaining states are in the process of amending their respecting APMC Acts.<br>

<b>Agricultural Holding:</b>

            The average size of holding in India is continuously decreasing due to rapid and high population growth. The continuous division and fragmentation of holdings has increased the number of holdings, obviously of smaller size. According to the results of Agriculture Census 1990-91, the total number of operational holdings in the country had increased from 972 million in 1985-86 to 1,066million in 1990-91. Operated area, on the other hand, had risen only marginally, i.e., by about 0.65. Rise in number of holdings without corresponding increase in area clearly showed pressure of population on land with average size of holding declining from 1.69 hectare in 1985-86 to 1.55 hectare in 1990-91. 59% of total operational holdings in 1990-91 were of size less than 1 hectare (i.e. marginal holdings), 32.2% of size between 1-4 hectares (i.e. small holdings). 7.25 of size between 4-10 hectares (i.e. medium holdings) and only 1.6% of size more than 10 hectares (i.e. large holdings)
<br>
            In 1985-86, Rajasthan was having the highest average holding size of 4.34 hectares, followed by Punjab having an average size of 3.77 hectares. Contrary to it, Kerala was having the lowest average holding size of 0.36 hectares (1985-86 data are the latest).<br>

<b>New National Agricultural Policy:</b>

            Union Government has announced new National Agricultural Policy in the Parliament on July 28, 2000. This policy has been planned under the provisions of World Trade Organisation so as to face the challenges of agriculture sector. This policy gives emphasis on promoting agricultural exports after fulfilling domestic demand. The salient features of this policy are:
<ul>

        <li>4% growth rate p.a. for the next two decades.</li>

        <li>Land reforms to provide land to poor farmers.</li>

        <li>Consolidation of holdings in all states of the nation.</li>

        <li>Promoting private investments in agriculture.</li>

        <li>To provide insurance umbrella for crops to farmers.</li>

        <li>To promote biotechnology.</li>

        <li>Promoting research for developing new varieties and ensuring protection to the developed varieties.</li>
</ul>
<b>New Agriculture Policy has been described as ‘Rainbow Revolution’ which includes the following revolutions:</b>

<b>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana:</b>

            The new Crop Insurance Scheme is in line with One Nation-One Scheme theme. It incorporates the best features of all previous schemes and at the same time, all previous shortcomings/weakness have been removed. The PMFBY will replace the existing two Schemes National Agricultural Insurance scheme as well as the Modified NAIS.<br>

<b>Highlights of the scheme</b>
<ul>
      <li>  There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%. The premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low and balance premium will be paid by the Government to provide full insured amount to the farmers against crop loss on account of natural calamities.</li>

      <li>  There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.</li>

       <li> Earlier, there was a provision of capping the premium rate which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This capping was done to limit Government outgo on the premium subsidy. This capping has now been removed and farmers will get claim against full sum insured without any reduction.</li>

       <li> The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent. Smart phones will be used to capture and upload data of crop cutting to reduce the delays in claim payment to farmers. Remote sensing will be used to reduce the number of crop cutting experiments.</li>

       <li> PMFBY is a replacement scheme of NAIS/MNAIS, there will be exemption from Service tax liability of all the services involved in the implementation of the scheme. It is estimated that the new scheme will ensure about 75-80 percent of subsidy for the farmers in insurance premium.</li>

<b>Fisheries:</b>

            Indian fisheries and aquaculture is an important sector of food production, providing nutritional security to the food basket, contributing to the agricultural exports and engaging about fourteen million people in different activities.
            <br><br>
            The National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) has been set up to realise the untapped potential of the fishery sector with the application of modern tools of research and development including biotechnology. The board was registered in July 2006 under the Andhra Pradesh Societies Registration Act, 2001, and has become operational.
            <br><br>
            The geographic base of Indian marine fisheries has 8,118 km coastline, 2.02 million sq. km of Exclusive Economic Zone including 0.5 million sq. km of continental shelf and 3,937 fishing villages. There are 189 traditional fish landing centres, 59 minor fishing harbours and 6 major fishing harbours, which serve as bases for about 2,80,000 fishing craft consisting of 1,81,000 non-motorised traditional craft 45,000 motorised traditional craft and 54,000 mechanised boats. Out of 180 deep sea fishing vessels, only 60 are in operation at present. National Fisheries Development Board has been set up to realise the untapped potential of fishery sector with the application of modern tools of research and development including biotechnology.
            <br><br>
            The Board was registered in July 2006 under Andhra Pradesh Society Registration Act, 2001 and has become operational. The Coastal agricultural Authority Bill, 2005 passed by both Houses of Parliament became an Act on June 23, 2005. Rules have already been framed under the Act.<br>
            <br>
<b>Price Stabilisation Fund Scheme:</b>

            Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) refers to any fund constituted for the purpose of containing extreme volatility in prices of selected commodities. The amount in the fund is generally utilised for activities aimed at bringing down/up the high/low prices say for instance, procurement of such products and distribution of the same as and when required, so that prices remain in a range.
            <br><br>
            Many countries use such dedicated for stabilisation of major petroleum product prices, particularly if they are importers. Some countries use such funds for stabilising not just commodity prices but a variety of key macroeconomic variables such as the exchange rate (which is nothing but the price of the domestic currency expressed in terms of an external currency), benchmark stock indices etc. The operational details of such funds vary from country to country.
            <br><br>
            India first created a price stabilisation fund for some export oriented plantation crops in 2003, and this ceased to exist in 2013. Another fund was created in 2015 for perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities, but initially limited to support potato and onion prices only.
            <br><br>
            A Price Stabilisation Found of Rs. 500 crores for agricultural commodities was announced in the Union Budget 2014-15 with a view to mitigate volatility in the prices of agricultural produce.
            <br><br>
            Accordingly, the Government of India, on 27 March 2015, approved the creation of a Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) with a corpus of Rs. 500 crores as a Central Sector Scheme, to support market interventions for price control of perishable agri-horticulture commodities during 2014-15 to 2016-17. Initially the fund was proposed to be used for market interventions for onion and potato only and pulses were added subsequently.<br>

  <div class="menu-content industrialization"><h3>INDUSTRILISATION</h3><hr>

Industrialisation has come to be regarded as synonymous with economic development. The essential criteria that are being used to distinguish a developed economy from an underdeveloped one relate to the proportion of workforce engaged in industrial activity, the proportion of national output originating in the industrial sector, etc.
<ul>

        <li>Adoption of technologically superior techniques of production that help to transform basic raw material and intermediate goods into manufacture goods, and</li>

       <li> Application of modern techniques of management and organisation like economic calculation, accountancy, etc. Since technological progress is a necessary condition for fast economic growth, it is necessary to know about Appropriate Technology and Intermediate Technology.</li>
</ul>
<b>Industrial policy resolution, 1948</b>

This policy divided the industries into four broad categories:
<ul>
        <li><b>State monopolies:</b> This first category included the manufacture of arms and ammunition, the production and control of atomic energy and the ownership of railways. This category would belong to the exclusive monopoly of the Central Government.</li>

        <li><b>Basic industries:</b> The second category included coal, iron and steel, shipbuilding, aircrafts and telephones. New plants in these industries would be taken only by the Government.</li>

        <li><b>Regulated industries:</b> The third category included certain basic industries such as automobiles, tractors, heavy machinery, machine tools, cement, sugar, etc. The Government of India would regulate these industries because of the importance of these industries.</li>

        <li><b>Private industries:</b> The last category included all the other industries except the above. These industries were open to private sector.</li>
</ul>
This Industrial Policy Resolution also stressed the importance of cottage and small scale industries. Though the resolution felt the necessity of foreign capital, yet it wanted to regulate foreign capital. The Resolution stressed the importance of progressive Indianisation of foreign concerns. It also appealed for healthy labour-management relations. This policy outlined a mixed economy for India.
<br>
<b>New Industrial Policy, 1991:</b>

      A series of sweeping changes were announced by the Government in the form of New Industrial Policy on July 24, 1991. The basic philosophy of the new policy has been the attainment of international competitiveness and liberalisation of the industrial sector.
<br>
<b>Objectives</b><br>

<b>The New Industrial Policy seeks to achieve the following objectives.</b>
<ul>
        <li>To consolidate the strength build-up during the last four decades of economic planning and to build on the gain already made.</li>

        <li>To correct the distortions or weakness that may have crept in the industrial structure as it has developed over the last four decades.</li>

        <li>To maintain a sustained growth in the productivity and gainful employment.</li>

        <li>To attain international competitiveness.</li>
</ul>
<b>The pursuit of these objectives will be tempered by:</b><br>

 &rarr;  The need to preserve the environment, and<br>

 &rarr;  The need to ensure the efficient use of available resources.<br>

<b>In pursuit of the above objectives, Government has decided to take a series of initiatives in respect of the policies relating to the following areas:</b><br>

<b>Industrial Licensing Policy</b>
  <ul>
        <li>Industrial licensing has been abolished for all projects except for a short list of industries related to security and strategic concerns, social reasons, hazardous chemicals and overriding environmental reasons, and items of luxurious consumption.</li>

        <li>Only six industries groups where security and strategic concerns predominate are under the purview of industrial licensing.                                                       These are: alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, electronics, aerospace and defence equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals and industrial explosive.</li>

&rarr;   Where foreign exchange availability is ensured through foreign equity.<br>

&rarr;   If the CIF value of imported capital goods required is less than 25% of the total value of plant and equipment, upto maximum value of 2 crore.<br>

       <li>In locations other than cities of more than million population, there will be no requirements of obtaining industrial approvals from the Central Government except for industries subject to compulsory licensing.</li>
</ul>
<b>List of Industries Requiring compulsory Industrial Licensing</b>
  <ul>
      <li> Distillation and brewing of alcoholic drinks.</li>

       <li>Cigars and cigarettes of tobacco manufactured tobacco substitute.</li>

       <li>Electronic aerospace and defence equipment, all types.</li>

       <li>Industrial explosives including detonating fuses, safety fuses, gun powder, nitrocellulose and matches.</li>

       <li>Hazardous chemicals.</li>

       <li>Drugs and pharmaceuticals (according to the modifies Drug Policy in September, 1994 and subsequently amended in February, 1999).</li>
</ul>
<b>Competition Policy:</b>

       In order to improve competition and thus contain the distortions caused by monopoly power, the competition Act, 2002 has been enacted in December, 2002. It is a landmark legislation that aims at promoting competition through prohibition of anticompetitive practices, abuse of dominance and through regulation of companies beyond a particular size. This Act will replace the MRTP Act. This Act provides for the establishment of a Competition Commission of India which was established on October 14, 2003.
       <br>

<b>Companies (Amendment) Act, 2002:</b>

       This legislation will provide primary producers a new kind of organisation, i.e. a producer company to produce and market the products in a modern and professional manner at par with other companies. It will enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of cooperatives, and enable then to compete and operate in today’s liberalised, globalised market.<br>

 

 

<b>Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002:</b>

        The Act provides for the constitution of a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The functions that are presently being handed by the Company Law Board (CLB) (dispute resolution and compliance with certain provisions of the Companies Act, 1956), Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) (revival and rehabilitation of sick companies) and High Courts (winding up of companies) will now be handled by the NCLT, once the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provision) Act, 1985 (SICA) is repeated.

  <div class="menu-content privatisation"><h3>PRIVATIZATION</h3><hr>

<b>Meaning of Privatisation</b>

        The word privatisation, no doubt, has different meaning to different persons but literally it means holding of a firm/business in personal risk or the sole controlling body is not an authorising body of governmental departments. But in an authorising body of governmental departments. But in India, the word privatisation stands for the disinvestment of governments equity in PSUs and the opening up of hitherto closed areas to private participation.

       Privatisation refers to any process that reduces the involvement of the State/Public sector in economic activities of a nation. The privatisation process in a mixed economy of India includes.
<br>

   <b>    Denationalisation.</b><br>
<ul>
     <li>  Entry of private sector industries into the areas exclusively reserved for the State sector or which are considered exclusively reserved for the State sector or which are considered exclusive monopolies of State.</li>

       <li>Transfer of management and control of public sector undertakings and activities managed departmentally, e.g. railways, steel, posts and telegraphs, etc. to the private sector. It can take place through different techniques like:</li>

&rarr;   Franchising, whereby ownership would be private but the brand name and technical know-how would be provided by the public sector,

&rarr;   Contracting out a government service,

&rarr;   Leasing out physical facilities to private operators, and

&rarr;   Disinvestment through equity sales.

       <li>Limiting the scope of the public sector or no more diversification of existing public sector undertakings.</li>
</ul>
<b>Attempts of Privatisation in India</b><br>

      <b>The new Industrial Policy announced by the Government of India in July 1991 emphasised the following four measures to reform the public sector enterprises:</b>
<ul>
       <li>Reduction in the number of reserved industry for public sector: Now only 3 industries are reserved exclusively for the public sector.</li>

       <li>Policy regarding sick PSUs to be the same as that for private sector: The 1991 Industrial Policy sector not at par with the private sector units.  Now the public sector units have also been brought within the jurisdiction of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).</li>

      <li> <b>Memorandum of Undertaking (MoU):</b> The main objective of MoU is to reduce the quantity of control and increase the quality of accountability. Over the years, the MoU system has grown at a steady rate, from 4 MoUs in 1987-88 to 99 in 2004-05. On the basis of the MoU performance evaluation carried for the year 2004-05 the number of excellent rated PSEs was 42.33 PSEs were rated as very good.</li>
</ul>
<b>MoU for PSUs:</b>

      The Government on the recommendations of the “committee to review the policy for the public enterprises” (Arjun Sengupta Committee 1985) has entered into Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) with a number of PSUs. The real purpose of MoU is to manage PSEs by management by objectives rather than management by control. For the first time, since the inception of public sector, an attempt has been made to free them from the administrative control of the ministries and permit them to operate autonomously in a competitive environment.
    
          </div>
  <div class="menu-content disinvestment"><h3>DISINVESTMENT</h3><hr>

     <b>The major plank of the privatisation in India has been the disinvestments of government equity in a select number of profit-making public enterprises.</b>

<br> 

<b>Objectives of Disinvestment</b>
<ul>
       The overall objective of the disinvestments policy is to raise resources from within the public sector for meeting the following categories of costs associated with the transforming of the Indian Public sector.

      <li> A part of these resources will be used to pay for the cost associated with the closure of enterprises declared as terminally sick by BIFR. These costs would primarily include expenses relating to voluntary retirement schemes.</li>

       <li>A big part of money raised from disinvestments will be used for retraining of the workers displaced or affected as a result of the closure and internal restructuring involving downsizing.</li>

       <li>The main rationale behind disinvestments is to raise non-inflationary form of finance for the budget, all other objectives are subsidiary to this main objectives.</li>
</ul>
<b>Methodology of Disinvestment:</b>

       The government does not seem to have a clear policy on the methodology of disinvestments. The Government followed the policy of open auction sale and allowed NRIs and other persons legally permitted to hold equity to participate. But later in 1999-2000 the Government shifted to strategic sale. But it is intriguing that in case of BPCL, Government adopted the public offering methodology and in case of HPCL to a strategic investor.
       <br>

<b>Rangarajan Committee on PSU Disinvestment, 1993:</b>

       The Government appointed a Committee under the chairmanship of Shirt C. Rangarajan to recommend fresh modalities for undertaking disinvestment. The committee submitted its Report to the Government in June, 1993.<br>

       <b>The major recommendation of the Committee can be summarised as follows:</b>
<ul>
      <li> The Government should identify the public sector unit in which the equity should be disinvested.</li>

       <li>The Government should retain majority equity control in PSUs operating in strategically important areas like defence and atomic energy. In the rest of PSUs, the government could disinvest up to any level.</li>

     <li>  Workers interest should be protected in the event of disinvestment. Employees of the disinvested PSUs should also be allowed to buy share</li>.

       <li>A transparent mechanism for disinvesting PSU shares is called for.</li>

       <li>An autonomous agency with total responsibility for off loading government shares in the identified PSUs be set-up.</li>
</ul>
<b>In August, 1996, a five member Disinvestment Commission was set up. The

Commission was headed by G.V.Ramkrishna, a former Planning Commission member and a former Chairman of SEBI. Apart from drawing out a detailed disinvestment strategy, the Commission also referred:</b>
<ul>
       <li> To draw a long-term disinvestment programme within 5 to 10 years for the PSUs</li>.

        <li>To determine the extent of disinvestment in each PSUs.</li>

        <li>To private PSUs referred to it by the core group in terms of overall disinvestment programmes.</li>

        <li>To recommend the preferred modes of disinvestment.</li>

        <li>To select the financial advisors for the specified PSUs to facilitate the disinvestment process.</li>

        <li>To supervise the overall sale process and take decisions on the instruments as well as the pricing.</li>

        <li>To ensure that appropriate measures are taken during the disinvestment process to protect the interest of employees.</li>
</ul>

</div>
  <div class="menu-content cooperative-sector"><h3>COOPERATIVE SECTOR</h3><hr>

      In the mixed economy, along with the private and the joint sector, the growth of the cooperative sector too has been encouraged as a part of the State’s economic policy. The first Plan envisaged the cooperative sector to cover a number of vital areas like agriculture, rural and small-scale industry, retail distribution, housing, etc.
<br><br>
      <b>The important objectives of the development of the cooperative sector have been as follows:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Prevention of concentration of economic power;</li>

        <li>Wider dispersal of ownership of productive resources;</li>

        <li>Active involvement of people in the development programmes;</li>

        <li>Augmentation of the productive resources;</li>

        <li>Liquidation of unemployment and poverty, etc.</li>
</ul>
      <b>One of the important aspects of the development of the cooperative sector in India, as in other countries, is the State participation. The important ways by which the state patronises the cooperative sector in India are as follows:</b>
<ul>
       <li> State partnership in the share capital of cooperatives,</li>

        <li>Loans to societies,</li>

        <li>Subsidies and grants,</li>

       <li> Guarantee,</li>

        <li>Contribution to sick fund,</li>

        <li>Tax concessions,</li>

        <li>Legal concessions and sanctions,</li>

        <li>Training and education,</li>

        <li>Assistance to the Reserve Bank and other organisations that help cooperatives, and</li>

        <li>Arrangements for training and education of personnel.</li>
</ul>

      However, in spite of State patronage, the growth of the cooperative sector in industry has been rather slow. Its growth has been inhibited largely due to powerful vested interests.</div>
  <div class="menu-content msme-sector"><h3>MSEs</h3><hr>

      The Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) constitute an important segment of the Indian economy. During 2003-07, the MSE sector registered continuous growth in the number of enterprises, production, employment and exports. It is estimated that there are about 128.44 lakh MSEs as on March 31, 2007, accounting for about 39% manufacturing of the gross value of output of sector.
<br>
      Initiatives and measures taken by the Government during the year to enable MSEs enhance their competitive strength, address the challenges competition and avail of the benefits of the global market include.<br>

      <b>Enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006.</b>
<ul>
   <li>Amendment to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act, 1956 introducing several new features to facilitate professionalism in the operations of the Commission as well as field-level formal and  structured consultations with all segments of stakeholders. The new Commission has been constituted.</li>

        <li>A package for Promotion of Micro and Small Enterprises has been approved recently to address most of the concerns in the areas such as credit, cluster-based development, infrastructure, technology and marketing. Capacity building of MSME Associations and support to women entrepreneurs are the other important features of this package.</li>

       <li> An Empowered Group of Minister (EGoM) under the Chairmanship of the External Affairs Minister has been set-up to lay down a comprehensive policy for cluster-development and oversee its implementation.</li>

         <li>Under the Credit Guarantee Scheme, life insurance cover for chief promoters of units provided guarantee cover by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries (CGFTSI) has been introduced</li>.
</ul>
      <b>The ‘small sector’, as the name implies, consists of small-scale industries. In the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 and 1956, the small sector was given special role for creating additional employment with low capital investment. Following Dhar and Lydall, we can divide the small-scale industries into following three categories:</b>
<ul>
      <li> <b> Cottage industries:</b> These are generally associated with agriculture and part-time and whole-time occupations in rural and semi-urban areas.</li>

       <li> <b>Agro-based industries:</b> These industries are based on the processing of agricultural produce, or they cater to the input needs of the agriculturist. Agro-based industries may be organised on a</li>

  &rarr; cottage scale,<br>

  &rarr; <li>small scale, or<br>

  &rarr; <li>large scale.<br>
</ul>
Large-scale, agro-based industries are generally set up in large cities, or in semi-urban areas. Rural agro-based industries are generally organised either on a cottage or small-scale basis and possess most of their characteristics.

        <li><b>Small-scale industries:</b> We can distinguish between two types of small industries:</li>
<ul>
&rarr; <b> Modern small-scale manufacturing enterprises:</b> These are small-firms using “modern techniques to produce modern product”.<br>

&rarr;  <b>Intermediate group of small enterprises:</b> These firms use more or less traditional techniques to produce more or less modern products.<br>
</ul>
<b>Cottage Industry and Small Industries</b><br>

      We can distinguish between these two types on the basis of their links with the rest of the system rather than in terms of their absolute size or technological considerations alone. These links are of the technical or input-output kind as well as of the general economic kind. Small industries are technically and economically connected with large-scale sector which the cottage industries generally are not.<br>

<b>Small Industry and Large Industry</b><br>

      The difference between the small and the large industries arises largely because of the distinct organisational character of the former which is indicated by such factors as ownership, management, technique, flow of inputs and output, localisation and finally the historic sequence of development. In the official industrial policy formulation, as small industry is defined as a unit having investment up to 60 lakh in plant and machinery.
<br>
      To step up credit to the unorganised sector, the commission suggested that micro enterprises should be provided credit at an interest rate of 7% on loans up to 3 lakh.
<br>
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006
<br>
      Small and Medium Enterprises Development Bill, 2005 (which was introduced in the Parliament on May 12, 2005) has been approved by the President and thus become an Act. This new Act, 2006, has become effective from October 2, 2006. This Act makes a different category for medium level enterprises.

 
<br>
<b>Salient Features of the Act</b>
<ul>
        <li>It provides the first-ever legal framework for recognition of the concept of ‘enterprises’ (comprising both manufacturing and services) and integrating the three-tiers of these enterprises, viz. Micro, small and medium.</li>

        <li>Under the Act, enterprises have been categorised broadly into those engaged in (i) manufacturing and (ii) providing/rendering of services. Both categorise have been further classified into micro, small and medium enterprises, based on their investment in plant and machinery (for manufacturing enterprises) or in equipment (in case of enterprises providing or rendering services) as under:</li>


      <li><b>Manufacturing enterprises:</b> Micro Enterprises-investment upto 25 lakh. Small Enterprises-investment above 2 crore and upto 5 crore.</li>

       <li> The Act provides for a statutory consultative mechanism at the national level with wide representation of all sections of stakeholders, particularly the three classes of enterprises, and with a wide range of advisory functions, and an Advisory Committee to assist the Board and the Centre/State Governments.</li>

        <li><b>The other features include:</b></li>

&rarr;  establishment of specific funds for the promotion, development and enhancement of competitiveness of these enterprises,<br>

&rarr;  notification of schemes/programmes for this purpose,<br>

&rarr;  progressive credit policies and practices,<br>

&rarr;  preference in Government procurements to products and services of the micro and small enterprises,<br>

&rarr;  more effective mechanisms for mitigating the problems of delayed payments to micro and small enterprises, and<br>

&rarr;  simplification of the process of closure of business by all three categories of enterprises.<br>

  <div class="menu-content nimz"><h3>NATIONAL MAUFACTURING POLICY AND NIMZ</h3><hr>

      The objective of the National Manufacturing Policy is to boost the country’s share of industrial production, employment; development of world class infrastructure and augment investments in India’s manufacturing space.
<br>
<b>Summary of the Policy</b>
<ul>
        <li>Manufacturing’s share in India’s GDP has been stuck at 16% since the 1980s. The policy aims to increase the share of manufacturing in the country’s GDP from the current 16% to 25% by 2022.</li>

       <li> The National Manufacturing Policy aims to create 100 million additional jobs in the next decade.</li>

        <li>The draft policy envisages establishment of National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) equipped with world-class infrastructure that would be autonomous and self-regulated and developed in partnership with the private sector.</li>

        <li>Each National Investment and Manufacturing Zone to have 5,000 hectares.</li>

        <li>Land will be selected by State Governments. Preference would be given to uncultivable land.</li>

        <li>Both state and central Government would fund trunk infrastructure.</li>

        <li>The policy embodies an easy exit policy and single window clearance in Zones.</li>

        <li>The NIMZ would be managed by special entity.</li>

        <li>The policy has envisaged fiscal sops to boost manufacturing,</li>

        <li>Small and medium enterprises to be reimbursed for technology purchase.</li>

        <li>Industrial training and skills development programmes.</li>

        <li>Flexible labour laws and simplified and expeditious exit mechanism for sick units.</li>

        <li>Relaxation in environmental regulations.</li>

        <li>Financial and tax incentives to small and medium enterprises.</li>

        <li>Incentives to states for infrastructure development.</li>

        <li>Incentives for Green Manufacturing.</li>

       <li> Rationalisation of business regulations to reduce burden of procedural and regulatory compliance on businesses.</li>

        <li>Increased focus on employment intensive industries, capital goods industry, industries with strategic significance and those in which India enjoy a competitive edge and the SME sector.</li>

       <li> Make industrial land (land acquisition) available through creation of land banks by states.</li>
</ul>
<b>National Investment and Manufacturing Zones</b>
<ul>
        <li>National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs) will be developed as integrated industrial townships with state-of-the art infrastructure and land use on the basis of zoning, clean and energy efficient technology, necessary social infrastructure, skill development facilitates, etc., to provide a productive environment to persons transitioning from the primary sector to the secondary and tertiary sectors.</li>

        <li>These NIMZs would be managed by SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) which would ensure master planning of the Zone; pre-clearances for setting up the industrial units to be located within the zone and undertake such other functions as specified in the various sections of this policy.</li>

        <li>To enable the NIMZ to function as a self-governing and autonomous body, it will declared by the State Government as an Industrial Township under Article 243O(c) of the Constitution.</li>

<b>Indian Money Market:</b>

            Money Market refers to a mechanism whereby on the one hand borrowers manage to obtain short-term loanable funds and on the other; lenders succeed in getting credit worthy borrowers for their money. In any money market, commercial banks are the most important lenders. These banks are, however, not merely the lenders of money, they also create credit. The central banks role is important as the controller of credit. The Indian money market is not an integrated unit. It is broadly divided into two parts, viz. the unorganised and the organised.
<br><br>
<b>Unorganised Sector of the Indian Money Market</b><br>

            Unregulated non-bank financial intermediaries such as fanince companies, chit funds, nidhis, etc. indigenous banlers and moneylenders operate in the unorganised sector of the Indian money market. Lendings of the  moneylender are rather small, but some finance companies, chit funds and indigenous bankers do a considerable amount of business. They pursue banking business on traditional lines. Some of them are:
<br>
            Unregulated non-bank financial intermediaries: Loan companies (also called finance companies) are found in all parts of the country. The exact members of Loan Companies are not known. In addition, a large number of partnership firms and individuals are engaged in lending business. The chit funds are savings institutions. They are of various types lacking any standardised form. A chit fund has regular members who make periodical subscriptions to the fund. The nidhis operate particularly in South India. They are in their characters as some kind of mutual benefit funds because their dealings are restricted only to the members.
<br>
            Indigenous bankers: Indigenous bankers are individuals or private firms which receive deposits and give loans and thereby operate as banks. Over the past four decades, the indigenous bankers have faced stiff competition from the commercial and cooperative banks. These bankers unwilling to separate their banking and non-banking activities.<br>
<br>
            <b>Moneylenders:</b> Moneylenders do not constitute one homogenous category. Broadly, they are of two types:
            <ul>

        <li>Professional moneylenders whose main activity is moneylending, and</li>

       <li> Non-professional moneylenders whose source of income is not moneylending.</li>
</ul>
The methods of operation of the moneylenders are not uniforms and their activities are generally localised.
<br>
<b>Organised Sector of the Indian Money Market:</b><br>

            The modern sector of the Indian money market is reasonably well-organised and integrated. Leaving aside some highly developed financial centers, the organised sector of the Indian money market is far more organised sector of the Indian money market is far more organised and developed than the money markets in most of the countries. The organised sector of the Indian money market comprises the RBI, commercial banks, foreign banks, cooperative banks, finance corporations, mutual funds and the Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) Limited. Broadly the principal constituents of the organised sector of the Indian money market are:
<br>
            <b>The call money market:</b> The call money market exists in almost all developed money markets. It is generally the most sensitive part of the financial system. Any change in flow of funds and the demand for them is clearly reflected in it.
<br>
            <b>The treasury bill market:</b> The market which deals in treasury bills is known as the treasury bill market. In India, treasury bills are short-term liability of the central government. Some important treasury bills which have been used in the recent days are: 14-Day Intermediate Treasury Bill,14-Day Auction Treasury Bills, 91-Day Treasury Bills, 182-Day Treasury Bills, 364-Day Treasury Bills.
<br>
            <b> The repo market:</b> Repo is a money market instrument which helps in collateralised short-term borrowing and lending through sale/purchase operations in debt instruments. Repo is the rate at which banks borrow from the Reserve Bank, while reverse repo is used to drain excess cash lying with the banks.
<br>
            <b>The commercial bill market:</b> The commercial bill market is the sub-market in which the trade bills or the commercial bills are handled. The commercial bill is a bill drawn by one Merchant firm. On the other generally commercial bills arise out of domestic transactions. The legitimate purpose of a commercial bill is to reimburse the seller while the buyer delays payment.<br>

            <b>The certificate of deposit market:</b> A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a   certificate issued by a bank to depositors of funds that remain on deposit at the bank for a specified period. Thus, CDS are tradable in the short-term money markets.RBI introduced CDs with the objective of widening the range of money market instruments and to provide investors greater flexibility in the deployment of their short-term surplus funds.
<br>
            <b>The commercial paper market:</b> The Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term instrument of raising funds by corporate. It is essentially a sort of unsecured promissory note sold by the issuer to a banker or a security house. On the basis of the recommendation of Vaghul Committee, it was introduced in the Indian Money Market in January 1990. The CP can be issued by a listed Company which has a working Capital of not less than 5 crores.
            <br>

<b>Commercial Banking in India:</b>

            At the time of independence, Indian banking system was not sound. There were hundreds of private banks under unscrupulous management. Hence, in 1949 two major actions were taken very important from the point of view of structural reforms in the banking sector:

       <li> The Banking Regulation Act was passed. It gave extensive regulatory powers to RBI over the commercial banks.</li>

        <li>The nationalisation of the RBI.</li>

In the two decades following the enactment of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Indian banking system developed in many respects. A significant change that occurred in this period was a steady decline in the importance of the non-scheduled commercial banks. The Banking Regulation Act provided extensive regulatory powers to the RBI and with that it became possible for it to carry out various structural reforms in the banking system.<br>

The establishment of the State Bank of India in 1955 and the creation of the State Bank group by nationalising eight regional banks in 1960 allowed scope for a new experiment in the Indian banking.
<br>
<b>‘Lead Bank’ Scheme and Branch Expansion</b><br>

            The area approach in respect of bank financing proposed by the Gadgil Study Group towards the end of 1969, culminated in the Lead Bank Scheme. It had the backing of Nariman Committee also.
<br>
            The Reserve Bank accepted the recommendations of the Narima Committee and prepared the ‘Lead Bank’ Scheme. Under the ‘Lead Bank’ Scheme districts were allotted to the State Bank Group, 14 nationalised banks and 3 private Indian banks.
<br>
            The Lead Bank was assigned a major development responsibility in the district allotted to it. It was expected to familiarise itself with socio-economic conditions prevailing in the district.<br>

<b>Indian Currency system</b><br>

            Indian monetary system is managed by Reserve Bank of India. It is based on inconvertible paper currency. The internal purposes are met by currency notes and coins. For external purposes it can be converted into foreign currencies.
<br>
<b>Important Terms Related to Currency</b><br>

            <b>Hard currency:</b> A currency traded in a foreign exchange market for which demand is persistently high relative to the supply, e.g. Pound and Euro Dollar.<br>

            <b>Soft currency:</b> A currency whose exchange rate is tending to fall because of persistent balance of payments deficits or because of the building up of speculative selling of currency in expectation of a change in its exchange rate. Governments are unwilling to hold a soft currency in their foreign exchange reserves.<br>

            <b>Reserve currency:</b> A currency which government and international institutions are willing to hold in their gold and foreign exchange reserves and finance as significant proportion of international trade.<br>

            <b>Fiat money:</b> Currency which is legally decreed as valid means of financing transactions. It is legal tender.<br>

            <b>Hot money:</b> Funds which flow into a country to take advantage of favourable rates of interest in that country. They influence the balance of payments and strengthen the exchange rate of the recipient country.<br>

<b>Classifications of Money</b>
<ul>
<b>Various Forms of Credit Money</b>
<ul>
        <li><b>Token coins:</b> All our coins are token coins in the sense that their value as money is far above the value of the metal contained in them.</li>

       <li><b> Representative token money:</b> This is usually of the form of paper, which is in effect a circulating ware house receipt for token coins or an equivalent amount of bullion that is banking it.</li>

       <li><b> Circulating promissory notes issued by central banks:</b> This is the greatest part of modern currency, and includes all currency notes in India issued by the Reserve Bank of India.</li>
</ul>
<b>Reserve Money:</b>

            In simple terms, Reserve Money can be called as government money produced by RBI (RBI is also taken as government) and let by the people and the banks. The reserve money is often called high powered money, basic money, primary money or monetary money. The ability of the banking system to create deposit money depends on the amount of reserve money available and the portion of which public holds in the form of currency. Reserve money is actually the cash held by the public and the banks.
<br>
<b>It is composed of</b>
<ul>
       <li> Currency in circulation-coins and currency notes held by the general public (C);</li>

        <li>Other deposits of the general public with RBI (OD);</li>

        <li>Cash Reserves of banks (CR) which are actually composed of two parts viz.</li>

&rarr;   Cash with banks themselves, and<br>

&rarr;   Bankers’ deposits with RBI (which banks correctly consider as their cash).<br>

<li>Thus, Reserve Money (RM) = C + OD + CR</li>
</ul>
<b>This means that RM is held party by the public (OD) and partly by banks (CR).</b><br><br>

CR is the very base for the entire demand deposit structure of the banking system. There are limits to the volume of credit creation in expansion of deposits; there should be enough cash with the ban king system to meet the depositors’ demand whenever it comes. The banking law requires a certain percentage of the deposits to be as cash reserve. The higher the percentage of cash reserve ratio + deposits required, the smaller the volume of credit creation and deposit expansion. The RBI can influence the volume of bank credit-bank deposits by manipulating the CR. If the whole of C + OD and CR is considered as reserve money, it is because C and OD also the potential of becoming CR without intervention from the RBI; the public could shift part of C into bank deposits or move part of OD into bank deposits.
<br>
<b>Monetary Aggregates</b><br>

            M0 = Currency in Circulation + Bankers Deposits with the RBI + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI.
<br><br>
            M1 = Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI = Currency with the Public + Current Deposits with the Banking System + Demand Liabilities portion of Savings Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI.<br><br>

            M2 = M1 + Time Liabilities portion of Savings Deposits with the Banking System + Certificates of Deposit issued by Banks + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) deposits) with a contractual maturity of up to and including one year with the Banking System = Currency with the Public + Current Deposits with the Banking System + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) Deposits) with a contractual maturity up to and including one year with the Banking System; and
<br><br>
            M3 = M2 + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) Deposits) with a contractual maturity of over one year with the Banking System + Call borrowings from ‘Non-Depository’ Financial Corporations by the Banking System.<br>
          </ul>
        </div>
  <div class="menu-content rbi"><h3>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA</h3><hr>

            The reserve Bank of India (RBI) was established as a shareholders’ bank on April 1, 1935. It retained this character for about fourteen years. Over this period important developments took place in India. The country got freedom on August 15, 1947, and the nationalist government decided to initiate the process of planned economic development. It was felt that a State-owned central bank was better suited to the requirements of the country. Hence, the RBI was nationalized on January 1, 1949.
            <br>

</ul>
<b>Control of credit by the RBI:</b>

            In India, the legal framework of the RBI’s control over the credit structure has been provided under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the Banking Regulation act, 1949. The RBI has been empowered to use almost all the traditional instruments of credit control under the former; the latter has given it additional powers to use some other direct methods of credit regulation.
<ul>
        <li>The Bank Rate Policy</li>

        <li>Open Market Operation</li>

        <li>The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</li>

        <li>The Statutory Liquidity ratio(SLR)</li>

        <li>Selective Credit Control</li>

        <li>Repos and Reverse Repos</li>
</ul>
<b>The RBI introduced the Repos in the Central Government dated securities in 1992 to even out interest rates in the call money market.</b>
<br>
<b>Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF):</b>

The Liquidity Adjustment facility (LAF) was introduced by the Reserve Bank in June 2000. It allows the Reserve Bank to manage market liquidity on a daily basis and also transmit interest rate signals to the market. The LAF, initially recommended by the Committee of Banking Sector Reforms (under the chairmanship of M. Narasimham), was introduced in stages in consonance with the level of market development and technological advances in payment and settlement systems. The LAF operates through reverse repo auctions, i.e., the sale of government securities from the RBI portfolio for absorption of liquidity and repo auctions i.e., buying of government securities for injection of liquidity on a daily basis, thereby creating a corridor for the call money rates and other short-term interest rates. The LAF has emerged as the principal operating instrument of monetary policy enabling the Reserve Bank to modulates short-term liquidity under varied financial market conditions.
<br>
<b>Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS):</b>

The MSS is an arrangement between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank to mop up the excess liquidity generated on account of the accretion to the foreign exchange assets of the Bank to neutrilize the monetary impact of capital flows.
<br>
            M1 measure represents the most liquid form of money among four money stock measures adopted by RBI. As we proceed from M1 to M4 the liquidity gets reduced. M3 is the most important component among all money stock measures which is generally termed as ‘Broad Money’.
<br>
<b>Marginal Standing Facility (MSF):</b>

            Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) is the rate at which scheduled banks could borrow funds overnight from RBI against approved government securities. Banks can borrow funds through MSF during acute cash shortage (considerable shortfall of liquidity). This measure has been introduced by RBI to regulate short-term asset liability mismatches more effectively. The MSF is pegged 100bps or 1% above the Repo Rate. To provide greater liquidity cushion the RBI introduced MSF. RBI announced the introduction ofMSF in May 2011.
        
        </div>
  <div class="menu-content monetary-policy"><h3>MONETARY POLICY TERMS</h3><hr>

<b>Bank rate:</b>

            This is the rate at which central bank (RBI) lends money to other banks or financial institutions. If the bank rate goes up, long-term interest rates also tend to move up, and vice-versa. Thus, it can said that in case bank rate is hiked, in all likelihood banks will hikes their own lending rates to ensure and they continue to make a profit.
            <br>
<b>Monetary policy objectives:</b>

            Going by convention, a central bank has two sets of tools-quantitative and qualitative-to signal easing or tight money conditions, depending on its policy objective. While quantitative tools would include imposing Cash reserve Requirements (CRR) for banks, fixing the repo or reverse-repo rates, the bank rate and prescribing the level of growth in the financial markets, pursuant with its growth objective for the economy. Popular qualitative measures would include imposing margins on certain loans and moral suasion. However, RBI often tweaks only the repo or reverse-repo rates and CRR. CRR is the proportion of deposits banks need to keep with the RBI.<br>

<b>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):</b>

            Banks are required to maintain a part or portion of the deposits they mobilise as cash with the central banks as CRR. Banks are required to park these funds on the average daily deposit mobilised on a fortnightly basis. This measure serves the policy objective instantly as liquidity is either infused or impounded almost immediately. However, this is not a very popular tool with central banks globally, though used by RBI often. Back home, even though SLR (the portion of deposits raised by banks that needs to be parked in government bonds, effectively controlling the amount of lendable funds in the system) is a tool that is in vogue. However, it is not often that RBI revises the SLR. RBI lends to banks at repo rate to manage their daily liquidity.<br>

<b>Repo rate:</b>

            It is essentially a short-term policy signal, the discount rate at which the central bank buys securities from commercial banks and infuses liquidity into the system. In other words, it is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks to manage their daily liquidity. The intent is to signal the cost of funds in the system and indirectly influence the quantum of growth in funds while the bank rate is a signal for long-term rates and is a refinance rate for commercial banks. However, the bank rate has not been revised by RBI for over a decade now. RBI sells securities to banks at reverse-repo rate to suck out excess liquidity from the system.<br>

<b>Reverse-repo rate:</b>

Conversely, reverse-repo is the rate at which the central bank sells securities to banks in order to suck out excess liquidity from the system. If RBI wants to discourage banks from piling up idle cash, it reduces such rates. This will then force banks to look at other options to deploy their funds and earn better returns. Under its current liquidity management strategy, the repo and reverse-repo rates serve as a corridor for the movement of the overnight call money rates for banks. RBI initiated measures to keep the country at bay from the global financial crisis.<br>

<b>Statutory Liquidity Ratio:</b>

Every bank is required to maintain at the close of business every day, a minimum proportion of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities as liquid assets in the form of cash, gold and unencumbered approved securities. The ratio of liquid assets to demand and time liabilities is known as Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). RBI is empowered to increase this ratio upto 40%. An increase in SLR also restricts the bank’s leverage position to pump more money into the economy.<br>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content capital-market"><h3>CAPITAL MARKET INDIA</h3><hr>

      Capital is often defined as ‘wealth used in the production of further wealth’. In simple words, it comprises the money and the money value invested in a business unit.
<br>
      The market of an economy where funds are transacted between the fund surplus and fund scare individual and groups is known as financial market. Financial markets in every economy are having two separate segments for short-term funds and long-term funds
<br>
      Short-term financial market is known as money market and long-term financial market is known as Capital market<br>
      <b>The securities market is divided into:</b>
<ul>
        <li>The gilt-edged market; and</li>

        <li>The corporate securities market.</li>
</ul>
<b>Gilt-Edged Market:</b>

      The gilt-edged market is the market in government securities or the securities guaranteed (as to both principal and interest) by the government. Since the government cannot default on its payment obligations, the government securities are risk free and hence are known as gilt-edged (which means ‘of the best quality’).
<br>
<b>Difference Between Money and Capital Markets</b><br>
<ul>
        <li>The money market deals in short-term funds which are used for financing current business operations and short-term needs of the government. On the other hand, the capital market deals in long-term funds required by industry and government.</li>

        <li>Short-term funds in the money market refer to a period of less than a year, while in the capital market long-term funds refer to a period up to 25 years.</li>

        <li>The money market uses such instruments as promissory notes, bills of exchange, treasury bills, certificates of deposits, etc. On the other hand, the capital market used long-term securities such as shares, debentures and bonds of industrial concerns and of the government.</li>

        <li>The central bank, commercial banks, non-bank financial intermediaries and bill brokers deal in money market instruments. On the other hand, stock exchanges, mutual funds, leasing companies, investment banks, investment trusts, insurance companies, etc. deal in capital market instruments.</li>
</ul>
<b>Securities and Exchange Board of India</b>

      The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) set up in 1988 was given statutory recognition in 1992 on recommendations of the Narsimham Committe. Amongother things, the SEBI has been mandated to create an environment which would facilities mobilisation of adequate resources through the securities market and its efficient allocation. The  purpose and aims of SEBI are as follows:
<ul>
        <li>Tegulating the business in stock markets and other securities markets;</li>

       <li> Registering and regulating the working of stock brokers and other intermediaries associated with the securities market;</li>

        <li>Registering and regulating the working of collective investment schemes including mutual funds;</li>

        <li>Promoting and regulating the self-regulatory organisation;</li>

        <li>Prohibiting fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities market;</li>

        <li>Promoting investors’ education and training of intermediaries of securities market;</li>

        <li>Prohibiting insider trading in securities;</li>

        <li>Regulating substantial acquisition of shares and takeover of companies; and</li>

        <li>Performing such functions and exercising such functions and exercising such powers under the provisions of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, as may be delegated to it by the Central Government.</li>
</ul>
      SEBI has been vested with wide-ranging powers. Firstly, to oversee the constitution as well as the operations of mutual funds including presentation of accounts, following the decision to allow the entry of private sector and joint sector mutual funds. Secondly, all stock exchanges in the country have been brought under the annual inspection regime of SEBI for ensuring orderly growth of stock markets and investors protection. Thirdly, with the repealing of the Capital Issue (Control) Act, 1947, in May 1992, SEBI has been made the regulatory authority in regard to new issues of companies. An amendment to the SEBI Act (1992) carried out of March 25, 1995 has empowered SEBI to register and regulate new intermediaries associated with the securities market are now regulated by SEBI.
<br><br>
<b>Participatory Notes (P-Notes):</b>

      Participatory notes, also referred to as “P-notes,” are financial instruments used by investors or hedge funds that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to invest in India securities. Any dividends or capital gains collected from the underlying securities go back to the investors. Indian regulators are against participatory notes because they fear that hedge funds acting through participatory notes will cause economic volatility in India’s exchanges.

  <div class="menu-content budget"><h3>BUDGET</h3><hr>

     Budget is a statement of estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for the ensuing fiscal year (i.e. 1st April to 31st march). It is also known as ‘Annual Financial Statement’. As per Article 112 of the constitution, the President shall cause to be laid a financial statement before both the Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every financial year of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for that year. Article 202 of the constitution provides that a similar financial statement for each states will be placed before the legislature of the respective state.
<br>
     <b>The annual budget statement presents four kinds of estimates:</b>
<ul>
       <li> Actual estimates of the preceding year</li>

        <li>Budget estimates of the current year</li>

        <li>Revised estimates of the current year</li>

       <li> Budget estimates for the preceding years</li>

      Budget implies that government is misleading out more money from the economic system. It has a contractionary effect.
      <ol type="a">
                                         <li>Fall in the level of economic activity</li>

                                           <li>Fall in consumption and savings</li>
                                         </ol>

     <b> Balanced budget:</b> A balanced budget is one where the estimated revenue equals the estimated expenditure. If the receipts of the government equal its expenditure the government will said to have balanced budget. A balanced budget will have a neutral effect on the level of economic activity.<br>

      <b>Deficit budget:</b> It occurs when the overall expenditure of the government exceeds the overall receipts. Budgetary deficits is financed by printing of new currency notes by the government. If the receipts of the government are less than its expenditure the government will said to have a deficit budget.<br>

      <b>A deficit budget implies that the government is pumping in more money in the economic system than is pumping out. The process works as follows:</b><br>
          <ol type="a">
                                             <li>Expansion in economic activity</li>


                                             <li> Rise in investment</li>

                                                       <li>Rise in employment</li>

                                                           <li>Rise in income</li>

                                             <li>Rise in consumption and savings</li>
                                           </ol>

      This will move the economy further on the growth path. The Government in a developing economy always plans for a deficit budget.<br>

      <b>The budget shows the receipts and expenditure of the government (centre and states) under three heads:</b><br>
      <ul>

        <li><b>Consolidated fund:</b> It is the main account of the government and it consists of all the receipts of the government from taxes, loans and other receipts. No amount can be spent without prior sanction of the Parliament (or state legislature).</li>

        <li><b>Contingency fund:</b> It consists of the sum placed at the disposal of the President to meet unforeseen expenditure. The prior sanction of the Parliament or state legislature is not required under this fund but it is sought to replenish the fund.</li>

        <li><b>Public account:</b> It consists of all receipts and payments which are in the nature of a deposit account with the government such as small savings, provident funds, etc. No legislative sanction is required for withdrawal of money from this fund as it does not belong to the government and comes under the public account.</li>
</ul>
      <b>Union Finance Minister’s speech:</b> Finance Minister’s speech gives a broad overview of the Budget proposals. Generally it is in two parts. The first deals with a review of implementation of the preceding year’s schemes, revised estimates for the completed year and the budget estimates for the next year, without taking into account the impact of budget proposals. Part two of the speech deals with revenue mobilisation through tax proposals.<br><br>

      <b>Annual Financial statement:</b> Annual Financial Statement (AFS) is the main Budget document. Under Article 112 of the Constitution, a statement of estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India has to be laid before the Parliament in respect of every financial year from 1st April to 31st March. It shows the receipts and payments of government under three accounts-Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund and the Public Account.<br><br>

      <b>Demands for grants:</b> The estimates of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund, included in the Annual Financial Statement and required to be voted by the Lok Sabha, are submitted in the form of Demands for Grants in pursuance of Article 113 of the Constitution. Generally, one demand for Grant is presented in respect of each ministry or department.<br><br>

      <b>Budget at a glance:</b> The Budget at a glance gives an overview of the budgetary proposals. It gives a breakup of tax and other receipts as well as expenditures (plan and non-plan), allocations of outlays by ministries and resource transfers to states and UTs, the projections on revenue deficit and primary deficit, etc.<br><br>

      <b>Finance Bill:</b> The proposals of government for levy of new taxes, modification of the existing tax structure or continuance of the existing tax structure are submitted to the Parliament through the Finance Bill. To facilitate easy comprehension of the budget, certain explanatory documents are presented along with the budget.<br><br>

       <b>Appropriation Bill:</b> After the Lok Sabha on the Demands for Grants, Parliament’s approval to the withdrawal from the Consolidated fund of the amounts so voted and of the amount required to meet the expenditure ‘changed’ on the Consolidated Fund is sought through the Appropriation Bill.<br>

      The presentation of Budget is followed by a general discussion on it in both the Houses of parliament: Estimates of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India are placed before the Lok Sabha in the form of ‘Demand of Grants’. All withdrawals of money from the Consolidated Fund are therefore authorised by an Appropriation Act passed by the Parliament every year. Tax Proposals of the Budget are embodied in Bill which is passed as the ‘Finance Act’ of the year. Estimation of receipts and expenditure are similarly presented by the state governments in their legislature before the beginning of the financial year.<br>

<h6>Structure of the Budget</h6>
<ul>
  
      <li><b>Structure of the Budget refers to the components of the budget. It has two broad components:</b></li><br>

&rarr; Budget receipts, and<br>

&rarr;  Budget expenditure.<br>

        <li><b>Budget receipts refer to estimated money receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year. Broadly, the budget receipts are classified as:</b></li>

&rarr;  <b>Revenue receipts:</b> Such receipts accrue to the government on account of its current activities and are generally recurrent in nature. For example, tax receipts like income tax, excise tax etc. and non-tax revenue receipts like income from PSUs, interest received etc.<br>

&rarr;   <b>Capital receipts:</b> Such receipts either create liabilities (like borrowings) or reduce assets like disinvestment, recovery of loans, etc.<br>

        <li><b>Budget expenditure refers to the estimated expenditure of the government on its developmental and non-developmental programmes (or on its plan and non-plan programmes) during the fiscal year. Budget expenditure is also classified into two broad categories:</b></li>

&rarr;   Revenue expenditure: Such expenditure is incurred on day-to-day activities of the government and neither create assets nor reduce liabilities, e.g. interest payments, subsidies, etc.<br>

&rarr;  Capital expenditure: Such expenditure either creates asset or reduces liability of the government, e.g. expenditure on construction of road, bridge, building etc.<br>
</ul>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content budgetary"><h3>BUDGETARY DEFLICITS</h3><hr>
<ul>
        <li><b>Budget deficit:</b> The budget deficit is the difference between the total expenditure and total receipts, other than internal capital receipts. It has to be financed through the sale of 91 days and hoc treasury bills to the RBI and drawing down of cash balances.

<b>Budget Deficit = Total Expenditure – Total Receipts = 91-day ad hoc treasury bills + cash withdrawals</b>

The issue of 91 days ad hoc treasury bills leads to the monetisation of the      deficit, (i.e. printing of new money), so government abandoned the practice of issuing such securities to the RBI since 1997. Instead, the government had initiated a scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA). Thus, the concept of budget deficit has become redundant.</li>

      <li> <b>Ways and Means Advances (WMA):</b> Under this Scheme, the RBI provides facilities for temporary accommodation of the financial needs of the government up to a ceiling. Now, yearly limits are divided into six months each, decided mutually between the government and the RBI at the beginning of a year. Thus, the WMA is purely a mechanism to bridge the temporary mismatch between the receipts and expenditure of the government.</li>

       <li><b>Revenue Deficit:</b> Revenue Deficit (RD) is the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts, i.e. R.D. Revenue expenditure – Revenue receipts (Revenue deficit shows the extent of reduction of assets or increment in liabilities of the government).</li>

<b>In simple terms, it can be understood as the excess of current consumption expenditure of the government (which does not yield any future benefit) over its current income. So, it is regarded as the worst kind of deficit from the perspective of economic welfare.</b>

<b>Effective Revenue deficit is a new term introduced in the Union Budget 2011-12. While revenue deficit is the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure, the present accounting system includes all grants from the Union Government to the state governments/Union territories/other bodies as revenue expenditure, even if they are used to create assets. Such assets created by the sub-national governments/bodies are owned by them and not by the Union Government. Nevertheless they do result in the creation of durable assets.</b>

       <li><b>Fiscal deficit:</b> Fiscal deficit is the excess of total expenditure of the government over the total receipts other than borrowings, i.e.,</li>

<b>F.D = Total Expenditure – Total receipts other than borrowings</b>

In other words, it can be defined as the difference between the total expenditure on one hand and the revenue receipts plus non-debt creating capital receipts on the other, i.e.,

<b>F. D = (Total Expenditure) – (Revenue Receipts + Non-debt creating capital receipts)</b>

Fiscal deficit shows the extent of increment in public debt, (i.e., total borrowings) during a fiscal year. It is the most comprehensive measure of deficit as it depicts the total resource gap of the government budget.

<b>Crowding out:</b> It refers to the reduction in private investment as a result of high interest rates due to excessive government borrowings.

       <li><b> Primary deficit:</b> Primary deficit (PD) is the difference between the fiscal deficit and interest payments, i.e.,</li>

<b>PD = Fiscal Deficit – Interest Payments.</b>

It reflects the status of the current operations of the government. That is, the extent to which current government policy is adding to future burdens stemming from past policy.

        <li><b>Monetised deficit:</b> It is also called Financing. It is defined as the net increase in RBI credit to the government during a fiscal year. Government borrowings from RBI directly add to high powered money i.e., printing of new money. It deficits the increase in the high powered money and leads to a multiple expansion in money supply, which generates inflation. Monetised Deficit is only a part of fiscal deficit as it takes into account borrowings of the government only from the RBI.</li>

<b>Public Expenditure</b>
<ul>
      Public expenditure refers to the total expenses incurred by the government on various heads. Public expenditure can be classified as revenue or capital development or non-developmental and plan or non-plan.

        <li><b>Plan expenditure and non-plan expenditure:</b> Plan expenditure refers to that expenditure whose provision is made under the annual budgets for those programmes and projects which are mentioned under the five-year plans. It includes expenditure on energy, social services, communication, transportation, agriculture, rural development, etc.</li>

       <li> Non-plan expenditure refers to that expenditure whose provision is made under the annual budgets on the items not included in the five-year plans. Simply, any expenditure other than plan expenditure is treated as non-plan expenditure. It includes expenditure on defence, interest payments, subsidies, expenditure on tax collection etc. (Note: Government Scrapped Distinction Between Plan & Non-Plan Expenditures in Budget 2016-17)</li>

        <li><b>Developmental and non-developmental expenditure:</b> Development expenditure relates to the growth and development activities of the government. This includes expenditure on education, health, industry, agriculture, transport, roads, etc.</li>

      Non-developmental expenditure is incurred on those items which do not directly promote growth and development economy. It includes expenditure on defence, interest payments, tax collections charges, civil administration, etc.<br>
      <br>
</ul>
<b>Public Debt</b>

      Public debt refers to the total accumulated borrowings of the government. Public debt includes internal debt comprising borrowings inside the country like market loans, compensation and other bonds, treasury bills, special securities issued to the RBI as well as non-negotiable non-interest bearing rupee securities issued to the international financial institutions. External debt comprises of loans from foreign countries and from international financial institutions like WB, IMF, ADB, etc.

      The other liabilities’ include outstanding against various small saving schemes, provident funds, securities issued to IDBI, UTI and nationalised bank, deposits schemes, reserve funds and deposits. While ‘public debt’                                     obligations are raise on the security of consolidated fund of India and are repayable out of it, ‘other liabilities’ are payable out of public Account Fund of India.

        <li><b>Regressive tax:</b> In regressive taxation, tax rate decreases with increase in income. It is reverse of the progressive tax system. Such system of taxation is against the objective of a welfare state as it tends to accentuate income inequalities. So, it is only a theoretical concept, it has not been adopted by any country of the world.</li>

        <li><b>Degressive tax:</b> The degressive tax system is a mixture of proportional as well as progressive taxation system, so it is also called mild progressive tax. Under this system, tax rate increases with increase in income upto a limit than becomes constant.</li>

</ul> 

<b>Classification on the Basis of Imposition</b>
<ul>
       <li><b> Ad-valorem tax:</b> Under this tax system, tax is imposed on the basis of the value of the commodity. Such taxes are equitable in incidents as they conform with the ‘ability to pay principle’ of taxation.</li>

<b>Direct Taxes</b>
<ul>
        <li>Direct taxes are those taxes in which the impact (levy and incidence (final burden) are on the same person, i.e. the tax is borne by the person on whom it is levied</li>

  <div class="menu-content gst"><h3>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</h3><hr>

<b>101st Constitutional Amendment act & 122nd Constitutional Amendment Bill</b><br>

      GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market.

      GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer.

      GST is a destination based tax means that tax would accrue to the State or the Union Territory where the consumption takes places. It follows a multi-stage collection mechanism.

      In this, tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a set off at the next stage of transaction. This shifts the tax incidence near to the consumer and benefits the industry through better cash flows and better working capital management.
<br>
<b>GST Council</b><br>

      As per Article 279A (1) of the amended Constitution, the GST Council has to be Constituted by the President within 60 days of the commencement of Article 279A.<br>

       <b>GST Council shall consist of the following members namely:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Union Finance Minister-Chairperson</li>

        <li>The Union Minister of State, in-charge of Revenue of finance-Member</li>

        <li>The minister-in-charge of finance or taxation or any other Minister nominated by each State Government-Members</li>
</ul>

<b>Structure:</b>

      It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying tax on a common tax base.
    <ul>
        <li>Central tax (CGST)-levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods and services.</li>

        <li>State tax (SGST)/Union Territory tax (UTGST)- levied by the States including Union Territories without legislature.</li>
      </ul>
      An Integrated tax (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services. Accounts would be settled periodically between the Centre and the States to ensure that the SGST/UTGST portion of IGST is transferred to the destination State where the goods or services are eventually consumed.
      <br>
      <br>

<b>GST would apply to all the goods except.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcoholic liquor for human consumption.</li>

        <li>Five petroleum products, viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel.</li>
      </ul>
<b>It would apply to all services barring a few to be specified.</b>

      GST would replace the following taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre:
      <ul>
        <li>Central Excise Duty</li>

       <li> Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD)</li>

        <li>Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD)</li>

        <li>Service TAX</li>

       <li>Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services</li>
     </ul>
<b>State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST are:</b>
    <ul>

        <li>axes on lotteries, betting and gambling</li>

        <li>State Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services</li>
      </ul>
<b>GSTN:</b>

      A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, taxpayers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST.<br>

      <b>The functions of the GSTN would, include:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Facilitating registration;</li>

        <li>Forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities;</li>

        <li>Computation and settlement of IGST;</li>

        <li>Providing analysis of taxpayers’ profile;</li>

        <li>Running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit.</li>
      </ul>
<b>Minimum Alternative Tax:</b>

      The Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) is the minimum amount of tax that a profitable company has to pay even if it is not liable to pay any tax as per the normal tax communication. There were instances when the earnings of some of the biggest Indian companies was more than the gross revenues of some states but these companies paid no taxes by taking advantage of various tax incentives. The government noting this anomaly; introduced MAT in 1983.<br>

      Very few countries apart from India have levied the Minimum Alternative. Tax USA is one. In USA, it is known as the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
<br><br>
<b>Laffer Curve:</b>

      It depicts the relation between the tax rate and tax revenue. It shows that as the tax rate increases, tax revenue also increase, but after optimum level, tax revenue declines with increase in the tax rate.<br><br>

<b>Mechanism of Resource Transfer:</b>

      The basic principle of federal finance is that all the constituent units should have adequate sources of revenue. It has further been realised that the States, left to themselves, cannot raise sufficient revenues to ,meet their functional needs. Moreover, wide inter-State disparities exists. An important objective of development effort is to remove these regional disparities. A consideration of these different factors points to the need for a balancing factor. Such a balancing factor is provided by the principle of transfer. Our financial system has provided for the transfer of resources from the Centre to the States. The important means of resource transfer are as follows:
        <ul>
       <li> Proceeds of some taxes assigned to the State: As described, above proceeds of some taxes that are levied and collected by the Centre are transferred to the States.</li>

        <li><b>Tax-sharing:</b> Similarly, proceeds of taxes that are levied and collected by the Centre are shared with the States, e.g. income tax and Union excise duties.</li>

        <li><b>Grants-in-Aids:</b> Provisions exist in our financial system for grants-in-aid of revenue from the Centre to the State. Grants may be broadly classified as ‘plan’ and ‘non-plan’ grants. The ‘plan grants’ are made on the recommendations of the Planning Commission whereas the ‘non-plan grants’ are made on the recommendations of the Financial Commission.</li>

        <li><b>Loan:</b> The Central is authorised to give loans to the State Governments subject to such conditions as may be laid down by or under any law made by Parliament. The loans are charged to the Consolidated Fund of India.</li>

        <li><b>Other source of transfer:</b> In addition to transfer of resources from the Centre to the States according to the recommendations of the Finance Commission, there are two other sources of transfer:</li>

  &rarr; Assistance of plan purpose from the Planning Commission, and<br>

  &rarr; iscretionary grants from the Centre to the States.
</ul>

  <div class="menu-content finance"><h3>FOURTEEN FINANCE COMMISSION REPORT</h3><hr>

      The report of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, chaired by Y.V. Reddy, was tabled in Parliament on February 24, 2015. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body that is formed once in five years and provides recommendations on centre-state financial relations.

<b>Recommendations of the 14th Commission</b>
<ul>
        <li><b>Devolution of taxes to states:</b> Tax devolution should be the primary source of transfer of funds to states. The share of taxes of the centre to states is recommended to be increased from 32% to 42%. Additional budgetary needs of the states will be filled by grants-in-aid to the states. The total revenue deficit grant to states in the 2015-20period is recommended to be 1,94,821 crore.</li>

        <li><b>Weights of indicators for share in taxes:</b> The weights of various indicators in the calculation of state’s share of taxes have been fixed at the following:</li>

  &rarr; <b>1971 population:</b> 17.5%, 2011 population: 10%,<br>

  &rarr; <b>Area:</b> 2% for smaller states, 15% for general weight,<br>

  &rarr; <b>Forest cover:</b> 7.5%, and<br>

  &rarr; <b>Income distance </b>(distance of state’s income from the state having the highest income): 50%.<br>

  <div class="menu-content frbm"><h3>Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003</h3>

     The FRBM Act, 2003 (as amended), which became effective from July 5, 2004 mandates the Central Government to eliminate revenue deficit by March 2009 and to reduce fiscal deficit to an amount equivalent to 3% of GDP by  March 2008.the annual targets for fiscal correction were to be specified by rules to be farmed under the FRBM Act on July 5, 2004.<br>

<b>Task Force on Implementation of FRBM Act</b><br>

      Following the enactment of FRBM Act, Government constituted a Task force headed by Dr. Vijay Kelkar for drawing up the medium-term framework for fiscal policies to achieve the FRBM targets. The Task Force was also asked to formulate annual targets indicating the path of adjustment and required policy measures. The Task Force submitted its report in July 2004. The Task Force recommended a path of fiscal adjustment that this front loaded and mainly revenue-led, with complementary reform efforts on revenue expenditure and enhanced capital expenditure to counteract the possible contractionary effects of fiscal correction.<br>

      The Task Force estimated that under the reforms scenario recommended by it, tax-GDP ratio of the Centre would improve from 9.2% in 2003-04 (RE) to 13.2% in 2008-09. Total expenditure is estimated to come down 14.3% of GDP by 2008-09 from 15.4% of GDP in 2003-04 (RE). A revenue surplus of 0.2% of GDP is estimated in 2008=-09. Fiscal deficit is estimated to come down from 4.8% of GDP in 2003-04 to 2.8% of GDP in 2008-09.

  <div class="menu-content balance"><h2>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</h2><hr>

      The Balance of Payments (BoP record the transactions in goods, services and assets between residents of a country with the rest of the world. There are two main accounts in the BoP- the current account and the capital account. The current account records exports and imports in goods and services and transfer payments. Trade in services denoted as invisible trade (because they are not seen to cross national borders) includes both factor income ( payment for inputs investment income, that is, the interest, profits and dividends on our assets abroad minus the income foreigners earn on assets they own in India) and non-factor income (shipping, banking, insurance, tourism, software services, etc.).
      <br>
      Transfer payments are receipts which the residents of a country receive ‘for free’, without having to make any present or future payments in return. They consist of remittances, gifts and grants. They could be official or private. The balance of exports and imports of goods is referred to as the trade balance.<br>

      Adding trade in services and net transfers to the trade balance, we get the current account balance. The capital account records all international purchases and sales of assets such as money, stocks, bonds, etc. we note that any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered as a debit and is given a negative sign. Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered as a credit and is given a positive sign.<br>

      Foreign investment is the equity capital which comes in two forms. Investments made in financial assets is called Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI). The investment made in physical assets by foreign individuals and firms is called Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
<ul>
       <li><b> Direct foreign investment:</b> Foreign capital can enter India in the form of direct investment. Sometimes companies of advanced countries start their subsidiary offices and affiliates in India. Alternately foreigners may subscribe to stocks and debentures of concerns in India. This is known as portfolio or entire investment.</li>

       <li><b> Foreign collaboration:</b> There are three types of foreign collaborations-joint participation between private parties, between foreign firms and Indian Government and between foreign governments and Indian Government.</li>

        <li><b>Inter-government loans:</b> Since 1946, the World Bank and its affiliates have been important suppliers of capital to India. International Monetary Fund (IMF), Aid India Consortium, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have been the major sources of external assistance to India recent years.</li>

        <li><b>External Commercial Borrowing ( ECB):</b> India has also been tapping export credit agencies like the US Exim Bank, the Japanese Exim Bank, ECGC of the UK, etc., to obtain a major portion of the commercial borrowing from the capital market.</li>

      It refers to the purchase of assets abroad but without any control over them. It involves investment in bonds, shares, securities or deposits with banks abroad. FPI is mainly a financial investment and can move out of a country at a short notice. The sources of portfolio investment are as follows:
<ul>
        <li><b>Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs):</b> These are investment institutions like mutual funds, venture capital funds, merchant banks, insurance funds etc., which invest in foreign securities markets.</li>

        <li><b>Euro issues:</b> It refers to the issue of securities to raise funds from a foreign financial markets.</li>

        <li><b>Global Depository Receipts (GDRs):</b> GDRs are dollar denominated securities issued by a foreign financial intermediary called Overseas Depository Bank (ODB) in lieu of the underlying domestic securities. Such securities (GDRs) can be freely traded in the foreign capital markets.</li>

        <li><b>American Depository receipts (ADRs):</b> The Global Depository receipts (GDRs) issued in USA are called ADRs.</li>

        <li><b>Participatory Notes (PN):</b> These are offshore derivative instruments issued by a Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) against underlying domestic securities.</li>

      After a subdued performance in 2002-03, portfolio flows rebound strongly in US$ 11.4 billion in 2003-04. The impressive performance of portfolio investment in 2003-04 was on account of a rapid influx of FII inflows, driven by the heavy bullish sentiments prevailing in the Indian stock markets.<br>
</ul>
<b>Foreign Direct Investment</b><br>

      Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to the purchase of assets abroad along with the power to control them. It is the most preferred form of capital inflows as it is non-debt and long-term in nature. FDI can be made by a Multinational Corporation (MNC) or by its subsidiary or by way of joint enterprise involving a MNC and a domestic partner.

      The benefits from FDI do not accrue automatically and evenly across countries and sectors. In order to reap the maximum benefits from FDI, there is a need to establish a transparent, broad and effective enabling policy environment for investment and to put in place appropriate framework for their implementation. Such an environment must provide incentives for innovations and improvement of skills and contribute towards improved competitiveness.

  <div class="menu-content fema"><h2>Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</h2><hr>

      Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was passed by the Parliament in 1999 and it came into effect on June 1, 2000. It seeks to repeal Foreign exchange Regulation act (FERA), 1973 but FERA was provided a sunset clause of two years to enable the Enforcement Directorate to dispose off the pending cases.
      <br>

<b>Salient features</b><br>
<ul>

        <li>Only authorised person can deal in transfer forex or security.</li>

       <li> No person residing in India shall acquire, hold forex, property etc., outside India except as provided in this act.</li>

        <li>Violation of FEMA would be treated as civil offence, unlike in case of FERA violation which involves criminal proceedings and arrest.</li>

        <li>Enforcement Directorate could not arrest but can search, seize forex, summon, adjudicate and impose penalty upto thrice the sum involved in such contravention.</li>
</ul>
<b>Export Finance</b><br>

      Pre-shipment and post-shipment credits are the customary banking credit facilities for exports. Traditional exports (such as tea), with foreign exchange from such exports realised typically within 180 days from shipment, require finance which is short-term in nature. Non-traditional exports, covering products such as capital goods, services and project exports, however, require deferred credit over the medium (1-5 years) and long-term (beyond 5 years and up to 10 years). Commercial banks, with their liability structure short-term in character, concentrate on traditional, short-term export finance. Export credit of schedule commercial banks amounted to 65,914 crore at end-March 2005. Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank), with its medium/long-term liability structure, concentrates primarily on medium to long-term export finance, besides working capital. Exim Bank also provides refinance and rediscounting facilities to commercial banks so that short-term exports are not affected by lack of finance. Exim Bank’s lending has steadily increased over the years. In 2005-06, Exim Bank’s approved loans increased by over 29% to 20,489 crore.<br>

      Exim Bank’s provides finance at various stages of the export cycle-import finance, product, development, production, marketing, pre-shipment and post-shipment-as well as for overseas investment. It has a range of export credit programmes, such as supplier’s and buyer’s credit, for Indian companies executing contracts overseas for projects, products, as well as services. The Exim Bank also extends guarantee facilities to facilitate Indian companies in executing export contracts and extends lines of credit, on its owner at the behest of the Government of India, to overseas government, or to agencies nominated by them, or to financial institutions overseas for encouraging imports from India on deferred payment term. Exim Bank’s import lines of credit provide financing for imports of capital goods and related services particularly for enhancing export production capabilities of small and medium-sised export-oriented units.<br>

<b>Types of Foreign Trade Policy</b><br>

      <b>Free trade versus Protection:</b> Free trade policy refers to the trade policy that is free from all artificial barriers of trade like tariffs, quantitative restrictions and other devices obstructing the movement of goods between countries. Protection the other hand, refers to government policy of providing protection to the domestic industries from foreign competition. The domestic industries are protected by imposing import duties which raise the price of foreign goods and by imposing various trade barriers.<br>

     Outward oriented strategy versus Inward oriented strategy: Under outward-oriented strategy, trade and industrial policies do not discriminate between production for the domestic goods and foreign goods. Government imposes least restrictions on trade and foreign investment. While under the inward-oriented strategy, government accords high levels of protection for domestic industries through trade barriers and direct controls on imports and foreign investment.<br>

<b>Trade barriers</b><br>
<ul>
      Trade barriers refer to the government measures which obstructs the free flow of goods and services across national borders. Trade barriers can be classified under two groups i.e., tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers.<br>

        <li><b>Tariff barriers:</b>Tariff refer to the taxes imposed on internationally traded commodities when they cross national i.e., customs duties like import and export taxes.</li>
</ul>
<b>Non-tariff barriers (NTBs):</b> NTBs refers to the restrictions on trade other than custom duties. NTBs include Quantitative Restrictions (QRs), Import Licencing, cannalisation, foreign exchange controls, etc. QRs refer to the fixation of ceiling on the quantity or value of a commodity which can be imported or exported during a specific period.  

</div>
  <div class="menu-content globalization"><h3>Globalisation</h3>

      Globalisation refers to the integration of an economy with the world economy. An economy can be globalised by pursuing the free trade policy or the outward-oriented strategy. An economy may be integrated with other economies by removing restriction on the movement of goods and services, capital, technology and persons among the different countries. A globalised economy becomes a part of the global economy or global market. It is characterised by the free flow of products and factors, uniform laws and rules, free exchanges and full convertibility of currencies. The prices of products, rewards of factors, exchange rates of currencies etc. are determined by market forces and are same across the countries.
<br>
<br>
<b>Advantages of Globalisation.</b>
<ul>
        <li>Globalisation leads to most economic utilisation of resources of the world because resources are allocated on the basis of ‘comparative advantages’, i.e., each country will produce those goods for which it is best suited.</li>

        <li>It promotes specialisation and division of labour on an international scale leading to greater efficiency and economy in production.</li>

        <li>It promotes competition and suppresses domestic monopolies.</li>

        <li>It enables the consumers to obtain a wide variety of goods from the cheapest source.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content excahnge"><h2>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEMS</h2><hr>

       Foreign exchange rate refers to the rate at which one unit of a currency of a country can be exchanged for the number of unit of another currency. It is the price of a currency in terms of another currency.<br>

       <b>Foreign exchange market:</b> The foreign exchange market is the market where the national currencies are traded for one another. There are two segments of the foreign exchange market, i.e., spot market and forward market.<br>

<b>Types of Exchange Rate Systems</b>
<br><ul>
        <li><b>Fixed exchange rate system:</b> Under system, exchange rate is officially declared by the monetary authority (Central Bank) and it is fixed. There are two variants of system:</li>

  &rarr;<b>Gold Standard System:</b> Under gold standard (or mint par value) system, the exchange rate of each currency is fixed in terms of gold.<br>

  &rarr; <b>Adjustable peg system:</b> Under adjustable peg (or Briton Woods) system, the exchange rate of each country was fixed in terms of US dollar, which was made convertible into gold at a fixed price. Adjustment in the parity value of a currency was allowed by the IMF under certain circumstances.

        <li><b>Wider bands:</b> Under wider bands system, wider adjustment in the fixed exchange rate is allowed. It allows adjustments upto 10% around the parity value between any two currencies.</li>

        <li><b>Crawling peg:</b> This system allows small but regular adjustment in the exchange rate bands for different currencies.</li>

        <li><b>Managed float:</b> Under this system, the exchange rate is market determined but the central bank possesses authority to intervene in the exchange rate determination by influencing the demand and supply of currencies. There are officially declared rules and guidelines for the intervention by the monetary authority. Managed floating with the absence of rules and regulations could be vulnerable to abuse of intervention. A particular country could manipulate the exchange rate of its currency to the detriment of other countries. This behaviour is called as ‘Dirty Float’.</li>

        <li><b>Flexible or floating exchange rate system:</b> Under this system, the exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply of the currencies concerned in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate is freely determined by the market forces without any government intervention.</li>

 
</ul>
 

<b>India’s Exchange rate Policy</b>
<br>
      The Indian rupee was historically linked to the British pound sterling till 1946. Soon after Second World War, the IMF was set up and as the founder member of IMF, India had to fix and maintain the external value of the rupee in terms of gold or the (U.S. Dollar). The IMF system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in early 1970s. In 1975, the Government of India delinked the rupee from pound sterling and directed RBI to determine the rate of exchange of the rupee with respect to the exchange rate movements of the basket of currencies, viz. the Pound, U.S. Dollar, Yen and Deutsche Mark.
<br>
<b>Objectives of Exchange Rate Policy</b>
<ul>

       <b>Following are the important objective of exchange rate policy and management:</b>

       <li>To ensure that economic fundamentals are reflected in the external value of the rupee.</li>

        <li>To reduce excess volatility in exchange rates.</li>

        <li>To help maintain an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves.</li>

        <li>To prevent the emergence of destabilising speculative activities.</li>

        <li>To develop an orderly foreign exchange market.</li>

<b>Exchange Rate System in India</b><br>

      Presently, there is ‘managed float’ system of exchange rate in India. The exchange rate is broadly market determined with selective intervention by the RBI. The focus of the exchange rate management policy is to smoothen the fluctuation in the exchange rate with no specific rate target.
<br>
<b>Effective Exchange rate</b>
<br>
      The effective exchange rate measures the strength of the domestic currency in relation to the currencies of its major trading partners. According to Salvador, <b style="color: red;s">“Effective Exchange rate is a weighted average of the exchange rates between the currency of a country and its most important trading partners”</b>.<br>

      In India, the effective exchange rates are complied in relation of five and ten major trading partners. (i.e., 5-country index and 10-country index). The effective exchange rates of two types are as follows:

       <li><b>Nominal Effective Exchange rate (NEER):</b> It is the weighted average of exchange rates of a current vis-a-vis the currencies of major trading partners. It is not adjusted for the changes in the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Real Effective Exchange Rate (REFR):</b> It is that type of effective exchange rate which is adjusted for the relative changes in the price level across the concerned countries. It is based on constant prices or real exchange rates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content important"><h3>IMPORTANT MONEY TERMS</h3><hr>

       <b>Hard currency:</b> A currency that is in strong demand and its value is expected to remain stable due to strong performance of its economy, e.g. US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro etc.<br>

       <b>Soft currency:</b> A currency that has a limited demand in the foreign exchange market and its value is prone to fluctuations, e.g. India rupee, Nepalese rupee, Libyan dinar, etc.<br>

      <b>Hot money:</b> It refers to the short-term funds held by banks and portfolio investments which quickly move out or into a country in anticipation of better earnings or in apprehension of adverse circumstances.<br><br>

<b>Terms associated with international trade</b>
<ul>

        <li><b>Dumping:</b> It refers to selling of a commodity in foreign market at a price, which is lower than either the price prevailing in the domestic market or the cost of production. The objectives of dumping may be to suppress competition in the international market, to dispose of temporary surplus or to advantage of large-scale production.</li>

        <li><b>Anti-dumping duties:</b> These are the additional customers duties levied by the comporting country to offset the low prices of imported goods due to dumping.</li>

        <li><b>Countervailing duty:</b> A tax levied on an imported product, which raise its price in the domestic market, as a means of counteracting unfair trading practices by other countries.<br>

Such duties are generally employed against imported products which are deliberately subsidised by the foreign government to promote their exports.</li>

        <li><b>Euro-Dollar:</b> It refers to US$ deposits in a bank outside USA.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <div class="menu-content poverty"> <h2> POVERTY IN INDIA</h2><hr>

<b>THE CONCEPT OF POVERTY</b><br><br>

       To understand the problem of poverty better, we must distinguish between absolute poverty and relative poverty.<br><br>

       Absolute Poverty of a person means that his income or consumption expenditure is so meagre that he lives below the minimum subsidence level. Because of his absolute poverty condition, he is not able to maintain his health and efficiency and in fact he may be starving.<br><br>

       On the other hand, Relative Poverty merely indicates the large inequalities of income. Those who are in the lower income brackets receive less than those in the higher income groups. The people with lower incomes are relatively poor compared to those with higher incomes, even though they may be living above the minimum level of subsistence. It is absolute poverty with which we are concerned when we talk of the problem of poverty in India. Affluent countries such as the USA have succeeded in removing absolute poverty from their people, but relative poverty, even prevails in them because of uneven distribution of income.<br><br>

       The Planning Commission adopted an alternative definition of poverty provided by the <b style="color: red;">“Task force on projections of minimum needs and effective consumption demand”</b>. Using the income poverty method, the Task Force has defined the poverty line as the midpoint of the monthly per capita expenditure class having a daily calorie intake of 2,400 per person in rural areas and 2,100 in urban areas.<br><br>

       <b>THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATERGIES:</b>
       <br><br>
<ul>
        <li>Seek to attain the most rapid growth possible and sustain it over a decade so as to increase incomes and the demand for labour. The Tenth Plan target GDP growth rate is 8%.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the pattern of output is as labour-intensive and capital-savings as possible without distorting the normal comparative advantage of products. This will maximise the demand for labour and avoid rising unemployment.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the best attainable growth rates are achieved by the States and areas with the largest concentrations of the poor. This will be helped by implementation of the good governance actions, summarised above.</li>

        <li>Provide additional Central resources for States which undertake effective reform programmes.</li>

        <li>Continue to give top priority to primary education enrolment and attendance, especially of girls.</li>

        <li>Similarly, emphasise primary healthcare and adequate nutrition, especially of children and women.</li>

        <li>Implement area-based programmes where the problems of poverty are greatest or most intractable, and</li>

        <li>Target vulnerable minorities which might not be able to benefit from other programmes.</li>


</ul>

  <div class="menu-content committees"><h2>COMMITTESS ON POVERTY</h2><hr>



<b>Alagh Committee 91979):</b> In 1979, a task force constituted by the Planning Commission for the purpose of poverty estimation, chaired by Y.K Alagh, constructed a poverty line for rural and urban areas on the basis of nutritional requirements. Poverty estimates for subsequent years were to be calculated by adjusting the price level for inflation.<br>


      <b>Lakdawala Committee (1993):</b> In 1993, an expert group constituted to review methodology for poverty estimation, chaired by D.T. Lakdawala, made the following suggestions:
<ul>
      <li>Consumption and expenditure should be calculated based on calorie consumption as earlier;</li>

        <li>State specific poverty lines should be constructed and these should be updated using the Consumer Price Index of Industrial workers (CPI-IW) in urban areas and Consumer Price Index of agricultural labour(CPI-AL) in rural areas; and</li>

        <li>Discontinuation of <b style="color: red;">‘scaling’</b> of poverty estimates based on National Accounts Statistics. The assumes that the basket of goods and services used to calculate CPI-IW and CPI-AL reflect the consumption patterns of the poor.</li>
<br>

      <li><b>Tendulkar Comittee (2009):</b> In 2005, another expert group to review methodology for poverty estimation, chaired by Suresh Tendulkar was constituted by the Planning Commission to address the following three shortcomings of the previous methods:</li>

        <li>Consumption patterns were linked to the 1973-74Poverty Line Baskets (PLBs) of goods and services, whereas there were significant changes in the consumption patterns of the poor since that time, which were not reflected in the poverty estimates;</li>

        <li>There were issues with the adjustment of prices for inflation, both spatially (across regions) and temporally (across time); and</li>

        <li>Earlier poverty lines assumed that health and education would be provided by the State and formulated poverty lines accordingly.</li>

        <li><b>It recommended four major changes:</b></li>
          <ol type="a">
        <li>A shift away from calorie consumption based poverty estimation;</li>

        <li>A uniform Poverty Line Basket (PLB) across rural and urban India;</li>

        <li>A change in the price adjustment procedure to correct spatial and temporal issues with price adjustment; and</li>

        <li>Incorporation of private expenditure on health and education while estimating poverty.</li>
</ol>
        <li>The Committee recommended using Mixed Reference Period (MRP) based estimates, as opposed to Uniform Reference Period (URP) based estimates that were used in earlier methods for estimating poverty.</li>

       It based its calculations on the consumption of the following items: cereals, pulses, milk, edible oil, non-vegetarian items, vegetables, fresh fruits, dry fruits, sugar, salt & Spices, other foods, intoxicants, fuel, clothing, footwear, education, medical (non-institutional and institutional), entertainment, personal & toilet goods, other goods, other services and durables.<br><br>

      The Committee computed new poverty lines for rural and urban areas of each state. To do this, it used data on value and quantity consumed of the items mentioned above by the population that was classified as poor by the previous urban poverty line. It concluded that the all India poverty line was 44.68 per capita per month in rural areas and 578.80 per capita per month in urban areas in 2004-05. The following table outlines the manner in which the percentage of population below the poverty line changed after the application of the Tendulkar Committee’s methodology.<br><br>

<br>
       The Committee also recommended a new method of updating poverty lines, adjusting for changes in prices and patterns of consumption, using the consumption basket of people close to the poverty line. Thus, the estimates released in 2009-10 and 2011-12 use this method instead of using indices derived from the CPI-AL for rural areas and CPI-IW for urban areas as was done earlier. Table above outlines the poverty lines computed using the Tendulkar Committee methodology for the years 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12.
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Rangarajan Committee:</b> In 2012, the Planning Commission constituted a new expert panel on poverty estimation, chaired by C. Rangarajan with the following key objectives:</li>

       <li>To provide an alternate method to estimate poverty levels and examine whether poverty lines should be fixed solely in terms of a consumption basket or if other criteria are also relevant;</li>

        <li>To examine divergence between the consumption estimates based on the NSSO methodology and those emerging from the National Accounts aggregates;</li>

        <li>To review international poverty estimation methods and indicate whether based on these, a particular method for empirical poverty estimation can be developed in India, and</li>

        <li>To recommend how these estimates of poverty can be linked to eligibility and entitlements under the various schemes of the Government of India.</li>

</div>
  <div class="menu-content unemploment"><h2>UNEMPLOYMENT</h2><hr>
<ul>
       <li>Structural unemployment is a longer-lasting for of unemployment caused by fundamental shifts in an economy and exacerbated by extraneous factors such as technology, competition and government policy. Reasons why structural unemployment occurs include workers lack of requisite job skills or that workers live too far from regions where jobs are available and cannot move closer. Jobs are available, but there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer.</li>

        <li>Cyclical unemployment is a factor of overall unemployment that relates to the cyclical trends in growth and production that occur within the business cycle. When business cycles are at their peak, cyclical unemployment will be low because total economic output is being maximised. When economic output falls, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the business cycle is low and cyclical unemployment will rise.</li>

        <li>Disguised unemployment exists where part of the labour force is either left without work or is working in a redundant manner where worker productivity is essentially zero. It is unemployment that does not affect aggregate output. An economy demonstrates disguised unemployment when productivity is low and too many workers are filling too few jobs.</li>

        <li>Seasonal unemployment occurs when there is limited need for a specific type of work to be performed during a certain time of the year. Professionals who work in a specific season often charge fees for their services, which provide the equivalent of an annual income, or work in multiple fields with different prime seasons. Industries where seasonal unemployment is common include farming, tourism and construction.</li>

  <div class="menu-content secc"><h2>SOCIO ECONOMIC & CASE CENSUS</h2><hr>
      <b>SECC-2011</b>
      <p>The Ministry of Rural Development Government of India, commenced the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011, in June 2011 through a comprehensive door to door enumeration across the country. This is the first time such a comprehensive exercise has been carried out for both rural and urban India. It is also expected to generate information on a large number of social and economic indicators relating to households across the country.</p>

      

<b>The SECC, 2011 has the following three objectives:</b>
<ul>

        <li>To enable households to be ranked based on their Socio-Economic status. State Governments can then prepare a list of families living below the poverty line.</li>

        <li>To make available authentic information that will enable caste-wise population enumeration of the country.</li>

        <li>To make available authentic information regarding the socio-economic condition, and education status of various castes and sections of the population.</li>
</ul>

        <p>The Ministry of Rural Development has taken a decision to use the SECC data in all its programmes. SECC data would have meaningful use in Housing for all, Education and Skills thrust, MGNREGA, National Food Security Act, interventions for differently able, interventions for women led households, and targeting of households/individual entitlements on evidence of deprivation, etc. the household data is also available for planners of programmes at State, District, Block, Gram Panchayat and village level. SEC provides an opportunity to simultaneously address the multi-dimensionality of poverty by addressing the deprivation of households in education, skills, housing, the deprivation of households in education, skills, housing, employment, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, social and gender mobilisation and entitlement. The use of the NPR TIN Number across programmes afford an opportunity to track the progress of households over the years. SECC truly makes evidence based targeted household interventions for poverty reduction possible. It paves the way for a Mission Antyodaya to work simultaneously in addressing the poverty of households through a Gram Panchayat Poverty Reduction Plan. The Ministry of Rural Development, in consultation with States, is trying to implement a convergent, integrated poverty reduction plan with Gram Panchayats and deprived  households as priority.</p>

                      <h3>BASIC CONCEPT OF ECONOMY</h3><hr>

<h6>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</h6>
  

            Economic growth is related to a quantitative sustained increase in the country’s per capita output or income accompanied by expansion in its labour force, consumption, capital and volume of trade. On the other hand, economic development is a wider concept than economic growth. It is related to qualitative changes in economic wants, goods, incentives, institutions, productivity and knowledge or the “upward movement of the entire social system”. It describes the underlying determinants of growth such as technological and structural changes. In fact, economic development embraces both growth such as technological and structural changes. In fact, economic development embraces both growth and decline. An economy can grow but it may not develop because poverty, unemployment and inequalities may continue to persist due to the absence of technological and structural changes. But it is difficult to imagine development without economic growth.

        <br><br>
            
<h6>MEASUREMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:</h6>

<ul>

<li><b>GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT:</b> One of the methods to measure economic development is in terms of an increase in the economy’s real national income over a long period of time. But this is not a satisfactory definition due to the following reasons:</li>

<p>&rarr; “Real national income” refers to the country’s total output of final goods and services in real terms rather than in money terms. Thus price changes will have to be ruled out while calculating real national income. But this is unrealistic because variations in prices are inevitable.</p>

<p>&rarr; This measure fails to take into consideration changes in the growth of population. If a rise in real national income is accompanied by a faster growth in population there will be no economic growth but retardation.</p>

<p>&rarr; The gross National Product (GNP) figure also does not reveal the costs incurred by the society on account of environmental pollution, urbanisation, industrialisation and population growth, It considers natural resources to be free and treats the earth “like a business in liquidation”.</p>

<p>&rarr; Further, it tells us nothing about the distribution of income in the economy.</p>


<li><b>GNP PER CAPITA:</b> The second measure relates to an increase in the per capita real income of the economy over the long period. This indicator of economic growth purports to emphasise that for economic development the rate of increase in real per capita income should be higher than the growth rate of population. But difficulties still remain.</li>

  <p>&rarr;An increase in per capita income may not raise the real standard of living of the masses. It is possible that while per capita real income is increasing, per capita consumption might be falling.</p>

   <p>&rarr;There is another possibility of the masses remaining poor despite an increase in the real GNP per capita if the increased income goes to the few rich instead of going to the many poor.</p>

   <p>&rarr;The real GNP per capita fails to take into account problems associated with basic needs like nutrition, health, sanitation, housing, water and education. The improvement in living standards by providing basic needs cannot be measured by increase in GNP per capita.</p>
 

Despite these limitation, the real GNP per capita is the most widely used measure of economic development.

<li><b>WELFARE:</b> There is also a tendency to measure economic development from the point of view of economic welfare. Economic development is regarded as a process whereby there is an increase in the consumption of goods and services of individuals. This indicator is also not free from limitations.</li>

<li><b>SOCIAL INDICATORS:</b> Dissatisfied with GNP per capita as the measure of economic development, certain economists have tried to measure it in terms of social indicators. Economists include a wide variety of items in social indicators. Some are inputs such as improvements in health in terms of infant mortality rates, sickness rates, etc. Social indicators are often referred to as the basic needs for development. Basic needs focus on alleviation of poverty by providing basic human needs to the poor.
<br>
The merit of social indicators is that they are concerned with ends, being human development. Economic development is a means to these ends. Social indicators tell us how different countries prefer to allocate the GNP among alternatives. Some may prefer to spend more on education and less on hospitals. Moreover, they give an idea about the presence, absence or deficiency of certain basic needs.</li>

<b>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX</b>

      Mahbub-ul-Haq and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen invented the Human Development Index and UNDP incorporated it into it first Human Development Report in 1990.
<b>ABOUT HDI</b>
<ul>
       <li> The HDI was created to emphasise the people and their capabilities should be the ultimate carrier for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.</li>

        <li>The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes.</li>

        <li>These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.</li>

        <li>The HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living.</li>

        <li>The HDI is the geometric mean of normalised indices for each of the three dimensions.</li>

<h6>INCLUSIVE GROWTH DEFINITION</h6>

            Inclusive growth refers both to the pace and pattern of growth, which is considered interlinked and therefore in need to be addressed together. Inclusiveness- a concept that encompasses equality, equality of opportunity and protection in market and employment transactions- is an essential ingredient of any successful growth strategy.
            <br>
            The inclusive growth approach takes a longer term perspective as the focus is on productive employment rather than direct income redistribution, as a means of increasing incomes for excluded groups. In the short run, governments could use income distribution schemes to attenuate negative impacts on the poor of policies intended to jump start growth, but transfer schemes cannot be an answer in the long run and can be problematic also in the short run. In poor countries such schemes can impose significant burdens on already stretched budgets and it is theoretically impossible to reduce poverty through redistribution in countries where average income falls below US$ 700 per year. Even in developed countries, redistribution schemes cannot be the only response to rising poverty rates in certain segments of the population.

<h6>FINACNIAL INCLUSION</h6>

            Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs- transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance- delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.

<h6>INITIATIVES FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN INDIA</h6>
<ul>
    <li>        The broad strategy for financial inclusion in India in recent years comprises the following elements.</li>

        <li>Encouraging penetration into unbanked and backward areas and encouraging agents and intermediaries such as NGOs, CSOs and Business Correspondents (BCs);</li>

        <li>Focusing on a decentralised strategy by using existing arrangements such a State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) and District Consultative Committee (DCC) and strengthening local institutions such as cooperatives and RRBs.</li>

       <li> Using technology for furthering financial inclusion;</li>

        <li>Advising banks to open a basic banking no frills’ accounts;</li>

        <li>Emphasis on financial literacy and credit counselling; and

        Creating synergies between the formal and informal segments.</li>

    <h6>Introduction</h6>

            National income is defined as the value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country, whether operating within the domestic territory of the country, or outside, in a year. National income is thus, a momentary expression of the current achievements of they people of expression of the current achievements of the people of a country expressed through their production activities.

            <b>National product is stock and quantitative concept.</b><br>

                        <b>National Product=Price * Quantity</b><br>

                                                   <b>NP= PQ</b><br>

            National income is the sum of return of all the resources involved in any economic activities. It is qualitative and dynamic concept and related to flow.

            <b>National income = Wage + Rent + Interest + Profit</b><br>

            National income can be defined in many ways. In simplest terms, it can be described as the income of all the people of a country during a year.<br>

            It is also defined as the money value of all the final goods and services product in an economy over a specified period of time. It indicates the performance of an economy in terms of production of goods and services. It is used as a measure of economic growth and reflects the productive power of an economy to turn out goods and services for the satisfaction of human wants.<br>

            <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</b> GDP is monetary value of final goods and services which are produced by general residents of country in own physical boundary.<br>

            <b>GDP = C + I + G</b><br>

            <b>Here, c = Consumption, I = Investment</b><br>

            <b>G = Government Expenditure</b><br>

            <b>Net Domestic Product (NDP): It is the difference between GDP and depreciation.</b><br>

            <b>NDP = GDP – Depreciation, NDP = C + I + G – D</b><br>

            <b>Depreciation:</b> It refers to the reduction in the value of capital assets, (e.g. machinery building, equipment, etc). Due to normal wear and tear and technological obsolescence. Depreciation is also called consumption of fixed capital and capital consumption. Net value is obtained by reducing the values of depreciation from the value.<br>

            <b>Net value = Gross value – Depreciation</b>

            <b>Gross National Product (GNP):</b> GNP is the sum of values of all final goods and services which is produced by citizen of a country in financial year and net earned income from abroad.<br>

            <b>GNP = C + I + G + (X-M)</b><br>

            <b>X – Income earned from export, M – Income expenses on import</b><br>

            <b>Basic difference in GDP and GNP:</b> In case of GDP of net income earned from abroad excluded but in case of GNP it is included. In India only two years 1972-73 and 1976-77 GNP was more than GDP. These two years are to be called golden years of Indian economy.<br>

            <b>Net National Product (NNP):</b> It is difference between GNP and Depreciation.<br>

<b>NNP = GNP – Depreciation</b>
<br><br>
<b>Real income:</b> Real income is national income expressed in terms of general level of prices of a particular year taken as base. National income is the value of goods and services produced as expressed in terms of money at current prices. But it does not indicate the real state of the economy. It is possible that the net national product of goods and services this year might have been less than that of the last year, but owing to an increase in prices, the NNP might be higher this year. On the contrary, it is also possible that NNP might have increased but the price level might have fallen, as a result of which national income would appear to be less than that of the last year. In both the situations, the national income does not depict the real state of the country. To rectify such as a mistake, the concept of real income has been evolved.<br>

            Factor Cost versus Market Price: Factor cost (FC) refers to the payments made to the factors of production (i.e. labour, land, capital, and entrepreneurship) of goods and services, while Market Price (MP) refers to the market value of the goods and services produced. Market price of the goods and services is arrived at by adding Net Indirect Taxes (i.e. Indirect Taxes – Subsidies) in the cost of production (FC).<br>

            <b>MP = FC +== Net Indirect Taxes</b><br>

            <b>e.g. GDP (MP) = GDP (FC) + Indirect taxes – Subsidies</b><br>

            <b>or, GNP MP = GNP FC + Indirect Taxes – Subsidies</b><br>

            Current Price versus Constant Price: National income at current prices shows the value of the goods and services at the market prices prevailing in the current year (i.e. the same year in which they were produced), while national income at constant prices shows the value of the goods and services at the base year (1993-94) prices. National income at current prices is called ‘Nominal national Income’ while national income at constant prices is called Real National Income, as it offers the effects of inflation.<br>

            <b>Deflation of GDP:</b> Conversion of Nominal GDP into Real GDP by adjusting it for price level changes is called deflation of GDP<br>

<b>Real GDP Constant Price = GDP Current prices * 100/Price Index Number</b><br>

            For example, the value of nominal GDP was 28.38 lakh, crore in the financial year 2004-05 and the (mid-year) value of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 185.57, then the value of Real GDP can be calculated as follows:<br><br>

<b>Real GDP = 28.38 lakh crore * 100 /185.57 = 15.29 lakh crore</b><br><br>

            <b>Capital Output Ratio:</b> The required capital for production of one unit is called capital output ratio.<br><br>

            <b>Capital Output Rato = Total capital / Total production</b><br><br>

           <b> C.O.R = Total capital/ Total Production</b><br><br>

            <b>Average Capital Output Ratio (A.C.O.R)</b><br><br>

            <b>Incremental Capital Output Ratio (I.C.O.R)</b><br><br>

            I.C.O.R = Increase in capital / Increase in production
            <br>
            <br>

<b>Methods of Calculating National Income</b>
<ul>
    <li>        Three methods are usually adopted to calculate national income.</li>

       <li><b> The Income Method:</b> This method measures national income at the stage of factor payments made to primary factor for the use of their factor services.
<br>
National Income = Compensation of employees + capital incomes on operating surplus + mixed incomes + net factor income from abroad.</li>

        <li><b>The Product Method or the Inventory Method:</b> It takes into consideration the total goods and services consumed in a year at market prices. This method needs an accurate census of production as well as wages census.</li>

        <li><b>Expenditure Method:</b> From the expenditure viewpoint, national income is the sum total of expenditure incurred on goods and services during one year in a country. It includes private consumption expenditure (C), domestic private invest (I), net foreign investment (X-M) and government expenditure (G).
<br>
National Income = C + I + G + (X-M) = GNP</li>


 </ul>


<b>National Income Aggregates</b>
<ul>

       <li><b> Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices (GDPmp):</b>GDP at market prices is the value of all fixed goods and services at prices prevailing in the market produced in the domestic territory of a country during a given year. Being gross, it is inclusive of depreciation, i.e. consumption of fixed capital in the process of production has not been excluded.</li>

       <li><b> Gross National Product at Market Prices (GNPmp):</b> It is defined as the aggregate market value of all final goods and services produced by national of a country during a year. It differs from GDPMP to the extent of net factor incomes earned from abroad. To get GNPmp from GDPmp, we have to add to GDPmp the income earned from abroad by the residents of country in the forms of wages, interests and profits.</li>

<b>GNPmp = GDPmp + Net Factor income from abroad</b>

       <li><b> Net Domestic Product at Market Prices (NDPmp):</b> Net domestic product at market prices is the value of all final goods and services at prices prevailing in the market produced in the domestic territory of a country during a given year after making allowance from depreciation.</li>

<b>Net Domestic Product at market prices is the difference between gross domestic product at market prices and depreciation.</b>
<br>
NDPmp = GDPmp - Depreciation
<br>
NDPmp is the measure of national income which is available for consumption and investment in the economy.
<br>
       <li><b>Net National Product at Market Prices (NNPmp):</b> Net National Product at market prices is similar to NDPmp. It shows the market value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country during a year after making allowance for depreciation. It differs from GNPmp in that the depreciation of capital is subtracted.
<br>
NNPmp = GNPmp – Depreciation
<br>
It is considered to be more accurate measure of  the true output of the economy than GNPmp.</li>

       <li> <b>Gross Domestic Product at Factor Cost (GDPfc):</b> It is the sum total of earnings received by various factors of production in terms of wages, interest, rent, profits etc. Within the domestic territory of a country in a year. If we deduct net indirect taxes from Gross Domestic Product at market prices, we get gross domestic product at factor cost. Being gross, it makes no provision for the depreciation.
<br>
GDPfc = GDPmp – Net Indirect Taxes</li>

       <li> <b>Gross National Product at Factor Cost (GNPfc):</b> It is the sum total of earnings received by various factors of production in terms of wages, rent, interest etc. By normal residents of a country in a year. It differs from GNPmp to the extent of net indirect taxes.
<br>
GNPfc = GNPmp – Net Indirect taxes</li>

       <li> <b>Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost (NDPfc):</b> Net Domestic Product at factor cost is the estimate of the domestic product in terms of earnings of factors of production within the domestic territory of a country in a year. It differs from gross domestic product at factor cost to the extent of depreciation.
<br>
NDPfc = GDPfc – Depreciation</li>

       <li> <b>Net National Product at Factor Cost (NNPfc) or National Income:</b> National income can be defined as factor incomes accruing to the residents of a country. It is the sum total of domestic factor income and net factor incomes earned from abroad.
<br>
NNPfc (or National Income) = domestic Factor Incomes + Net Factor Income earned From Abroad NNPfc = GNPfc – Depreciation
<br>
National income can also be found out by deducting depreciation from gross product at factor cost.
<br>
New Series Estimates of National income, Consumption Expenditure, Saving and Capital Formation (Base Year 2011-12)</li>

       <li> The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation has released the new series of national accounts, revising the base year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 base year of national accounts was last revised in January 2010.</li>

       <li> Base year revisions differ from annual revisions in National Account primarily because of nature of changes. In annual revisions, changes are made only on the basis of updated data becoming available without making any changes in the conceptual framework or using any new data source, to ensure strict comparison over years. In case of base years revisions, apart from a shift in the reference year for measuring the real growth, conceptual changes, as recommended by the international guidelines are incorporated. Further, statistical changes like revisions, in the methodology of compilation, adoption of latest classification systems and inclusion of new and recent data sources are also made. Changes are also made in the presentation of estimates to improve ease of understanding for analysis and facilitate international comparability.</li>

        <li> Improvements as noted above, especially incorporation of new datasets, have resulted in a correction in the level of GDP, which is likely to affect a wide range of indicators where it is used as a reference point: for instance, trends in public expenditure, taxes and public sector debt that are conventionally analysed in terms of their ratios to nominal GDP. It may be noted that the level of revision in the present base revision is not large enough to affect any of these ratios significantly.

<b>Meaning of Economic Planning</b>
<br>

            Economic Planning means the allocation of limited resources among different uses in such a way as to bring about the maximum welfare of the people. Economic planning consists of two basic elements. One is the determination of objectives and second is the provision of means for the achievement of those objectives. The detailed scheme is called economic Plan. The planning may either be centralised or decentralised depending upon the national requirements and degree of involvement of different sectors. The centralised planning refers to complete central control over major parts of the economic activities. Some of the decisions are related to investment in different sectors of economy, fixation of price structure, rate of wages and the amount of production of a particular commodity.
            <br>
<b>Types of Planning:</b>

            Planning can be categorised into various categories on the basis of the following.<br>

<b>Role of the Government:</b><br>
<ul>
        <li>Imperative Planning: It is also known as directive/totalitarian/authoritarian planning or planning by direction command. Under imperative planning, the central planning authority decides about each and every aspect of the economy. The target sets the processes delineated to achieve them are to be strictly followed. This type of planning is generally practiced in the socialist economies.</li>

        <li>Planning by inducement: Under such kind of planning, state regulates the private sector through the use of various incentives and disincentives (i.e. fiscal, monetary and industrial policy measures), so that the private sector may cooperate in fulfilling the targets and priorities of the plan. This kind of planning is generally practices in mixed economies.</li>

       <li> Indicative planning: It is also known as soft or facilitatory planning. Under it, state sets broad parameters and goals for the economy and endeavours to achieve them through persuasion and facilitation. The state provides all types of facilitates to the private sector and indicates the areas in which it can help in implementing the plan. It is based on French model of planning and generally practiced in capitalistic economics. It has been pursued in India since the Eight Five Year Plan.</li>
</ul>
<b>Extent of People’s Participation</b>
<ul>
       <li> Centralised planning: Under centralised planning there is a central planning authority which formulates the plan, fix objectives, target and priorities for every sector of the economy. There is a central control and all economic activities are directed in accordance with a single plan.</li>

        <li>Decentralised planning: It is also known as democratic planning, planning from below and grass root planning. A decentralised plan is characterised by the widest possible consultations with the various state governments and the private sector at the stage of formulation and implementation of the plan. The central plan incorporates plans under the central schemes and plans for the states as well as the district and village level plans.</li>
</ul>
<b>Economic systems:</b>

            The nature and scope of planning is largely determined by the nature of the economic system in which it is practices. Economies can be classified into the following categories:
            <ul>
       <li> <b>Socialist economy:</b> It is characterised by the existence of public enterprise or state ownership of capital in all the important spheres of the economic activity. All important economic decisions are undertaken by the planning authority. Such economies generally pursue planning by direction or imperative planning.</li>

        <li><b>Capitalistic economy:</b> It is characterised by the existence of private enterprise and ownership of all important means of production. Resources are allocated by the operation of the price mechanism by which buyers and sellers determine what goods and services will be bought and sold in the market, in what quantities and what prices. Such economies generally pursue indicative planning, as the role of planning authority and government is minimal.</li>

        <li><b>Mixed economy:</b> It is characterised by the presence of the features of socialism as well as that of capitalism i.e., public sector co-exist with the private sector-Resources are allocated on the basis of demand and supply with selective government intervention. Such economic generally pursue planning by inducement i.e., government regulate the activities of the private sector through persuasive measures like tax holidays, subsidies etc.</li>

        <li><b>Community economy:</b> It is an extreme form of a socialist economy in which all means of production are owned and operated by the state and private property is not allowed. It is modelled after the notion of Karl marx i.e., “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”. Socialism is said to be the preparatory but it has not yet established in any of the socialist country.</li>
</ul>

<b>Features of Indian Planning:</b><br>

            The important characteristics of the economic planning in India are as follows:
<ul>
       <li> Indicated Planning: Indian planning has assumed indicative character since the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97).</li>

&rarr; <b> Core Plan:</b> The concept of core plan enables the planning authority in formulating effective plans through realistic assessment of the resources. Under a core plan, the Planning Commission determines the expenditure head of state annual plans.<br>

&rarr; <b>Democratic socialism:</b> It connotes to the adoption of the principle of socialism (i.e., classless society) within a democratic (i.e., ensuring individual liberty) framework. It was Nehru’s vision of independent India in which all have equal opportunities in education, health, employment etc.<br>

&rarr; <b> Socialistic pattern of society:</b> It connotes to such a mixed economic system in which there are no economic and social inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth in a country. State owned means of production are used to promote social welfare and privately owned means of production are effectively regulated by the state through various instruments on the economic policy. It was adopted as one of the goals of the economic planning in India in the Second Five Year Plan.<br>

       <li><b> Decentralised and democratic planning:</b> People are involved at various stages of preparation and implementation of the plans.</li>

        <li><b>Comprehensive planning:</b> Planning process encompasses each and every sector of the Indian economy.</li>

        <li><b>Physical and financial planning:</b> Resources are assessed and allocated in both real and monetary terms.</li>

        <li><b>Perspective planning:</b> The five-year plans sets objectives and targets beyond the plan period, e.g. the 10th plan sets certain targets to be accomplished by 2012.</li>
</ul>

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>ECONOMIC REFORMS</h3><hr>

            The entire period of economic planning in India can be divided into two different phases- the first phase spreading over the plan period from1950-51 to 1990, while the second phase commences from 1991. The first phase laid down the basic objectives and strategies of development while the second phase showed a significant shift in the original objectives and strategies of planning leading to economic reforms.
            <br><br>
<b>First Generation Reforms:</b>

            The Economic Reforms of 1991 or the New Economic Policy is a complete reversal of the previous policies. These economic reforms were based on three premises Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG). These reforms seek to free the Indian economy from undue controls, give greater freedom to the more efficient private sector and integrate the Indian economy with the world economy. These reforms aimed at putting an end to the government’s Licence, Quota and Permit (LOP) raj by initiating the LPG mantra.
            <br><br>

            <b>Economic liberalisation:</b> It implies providing greater freedom to economic agents to take their own economic decisions. It generally means leaving the economy to free market forces with least government interference.
            <br><br>

<b>Salient Features of the New Economic Policy:</b>


            The economic reforms (First Generation Reforms) introduced the following policy changes:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Delicensing:</b> Industrial licensing system has been abolished for most of the industries.</li>

            <li><b>Dereservation:</b> the industries which were exclusively reserved for the public sector were deserved expect for a few.</li>

            <li><b>Deregulation:</b> The industries laws like Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act were amended to ease restrictions on economic units.</li>

           <li><b> Disinvestment:</b> The government proposed to sell the government equity (share capital) in certain Public Sector Units (PSUs) to the private sector.</li>

            <li><b>Easing of trade barriers:</b> The restrictions on imports and exports were removed and tariffs were lowered.</li>

            <li><b>Encouragement to foreign capital and technology:</b> Restriction on the operations of the Multinational Corporations (MNCs) were removed and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was relaxed to allow free inflow of foreign investments.</li>

            <li><b>Taxation reforms:</b> The tax rates and tax slabs were rationalised, taxation system was simplified and the loopholes in the administration were plugged.</li>

            <li><b>Fiscal reforms:</b> The government proposed to reduce the non-plan expenditure in order to reduce budgetary deficits.</li>

            <li><b>Banking reforms:</b> The interest structure was deregulated and greater autonomy was provided to the banks.</li>
</ul>
<b>Second Generation Reforms:</b>
<br>

            Economic reforms programme that began under the Rao-Manmohan Model of the economic reforms in 1991 aimed at delicencing and decontrolling vital sectors of the economy. It involved abolishing industrial licensing, opening of trade, disinvestment and privatisation, tax reforms, private financing infrastructure like power and telecom, etc. The 1991 policy had two parts: firstly to extricate the economy out of the deep macroeconomic crisis by undertaking ‘stabilisation measures’ and secondly to bring about certain structural changes’ in the economy. The first step was mainly a short-term measure while the second was generally of the nature of medium to long-term and designed to free the supply side of the economy.
            <br><br>
            These reforms have, however, left the factor markets such as labour market, capital market, natural resources etc. mostly untouched. The aim of the second generation reforms is to bring reform into these areas. The name, ‘second generation’ does not imply that we have successfully completed the first generation of reforms and should move to the next higher level.
            <br><br>
            In fact, the two generations of reforms are overlapping. Such reforms are complementary as well as supplementary to the First Generation Reforms. So the second generation reforms have two dimension, i.e. to carry forward first generation reforms and to initiate reforms in new areas.
            <br>
<b>Carry Forward First Generation Reforms</b>
<ul>
     <li><b>Banking sector reforms:</b> Such reforms should extended to encompass the entire financial sector. Reforms should be initiated in money and capital markets in the form of dematerialisation, corporation and demutualisation of stock exchanges.</li>

        <li><b>Taxation in Free India:</b> CENVAT should be converted into full-fledged VAT. Reforms should also be extended to the fiscal policy like reduction of the public expenditure borrowing, downsizing government staff etc.</li>
</ul>
<b>Planning in Free India</b>
<br>

           <p> The Planning Commission was set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in March 1950 in pursuance of declared objectives of the Government to promote a rapid rise in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of the country, increasing production and offering opportunities to all for employment in the services of the community.</p>

           <p> The Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility of making assessment of all resources of the country, augmenting deficient resources, formulating plans for the most effective and balanced utilisation of resources and determining priorities. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Chairman of the Planning Commission.</p>

           <p> The first five year plan was launched in 1951 and two subsequent five-year plans were formulated till 1965, when there was a break because of the Indo-Pakistan conflict. Two successive years of drought, devaluation of the currency, a general rise in prices and erosion of resources disrupted the planning process and after three Annual Plans between 1966 and 1969, the fourth five-year plan was started in 1969.</p>

           <p> The eighth plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing political situation at the centre and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were treated as Annual Plans. The eight plan was finally launched in 1992 after the initiation of structural adjustment policies.</p>

           <p> For the first eight plans the emphasis was on a growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries, but since the launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997, the emphasis on the public sector has become less pronounced and the current thinking on planning in the country, in general, is that it should increasingly be of an indicative nature.</p>

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>PLANNING COMMISSION</h3><hr>

            The defunct Planning Commission was an extra-constitutional and non-statutory body set up on 15th March, 1950 by a government resolution. It was constituted as an advisory body to the Union Government for the formulation of plans. The main function of the Commission was to estimate the resources and to prepare a plan for the most effective and balanced utilisation of the country’s resources. It was replaced by NITI Aayog in 2014.<br><br>


<b>Goals of Planning</b><br>

            Planning in India derives its objectives from the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the constitution. Goals and objectives of planning can be summarised into two categories, i.e. short-term and long-term goals. Short-term goals of a plan refers to the immediate and most important targets which a particular plan endeavours to achieve. Such goals are called focus of plan as they reflect the strategy of a particular plan. On the other hand, long-term objectives of planning are the general guiding principles of the planning process and reflects the aspirations of a welfare state. The long-term objectives of planning in India have been more or less same in almost all the five-year plans and are as follows:
<ul>

        <li>To accelerate the pace of economic growth in order to raise the standard of living of the people. That is to achieve higher levels of national income and per capita income.</li>

        <li>To achieve self-reliance in respect of the production of food grains, development of basic industries, technological know-how and foreign exchange earnings. It aims to eliminate vulnerability of the Indian economy to international pressures and disturbances.</li>

        <li>To ensure social justice to the people by eliminating poverty, unemployment and inequalities of income and wealth.</li>

        <li>To modernise the economy by bringing about structural and institutional changes in the framework of economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Self-sufficiency and Self-reliance:</b>

            Self-sufficiency implies that a country produces all commodities it requires within the country without having to import them, while self-reliance implies that a country has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to pay for its imports.<br>


<b>Growth Strategies</b>
<br>
<ul>


            <li><b>Balanced growth strategy:</b> It was advocated by R. Rodan, Nurkse and Lewis. It states that there should be simultaneous and harmonious development of different sectors of the economy, so that all sectors grow in unison.</li>

            <li><b>Unbalanced growth strategy:</b> It was advocated by Streeten, Singer and Hirschman, It states that investment should be made in selected sectors rather than simultaneously in all sectors. It is based on the premise that underdeveloped countries posses limited resources which should be invested in high priority sectors.

            The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, was formed via a resolution of the Union Cabinet on January 1, 2015. NITI Aayog is the premier policy “Think Tank” of the Government of India, providing both directional and policy inputs. While designing strategic and long-term policies and programmes for the Government of India, NITI Aayog also provides relevant technical advice to the Centre and States.
            <br><br>
            The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI Aayog to replace the planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to better serve the need and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quientessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism.
            <br><br>
            At the core of NITI Aayoga’s creation are two hubs-Team India Hub and the Knowledge and Innovation Hub. The Team India Hub leads the engagement of states with the Central government, while the Knowledge and Innovation Hub builds NITI’s think-tank capabilities. These hubs reflect the two key tasks of the Aayog.
            <br>

<b>NITI Aayoga is based on 7 Pillars of Effective Governance</b>
<ul>

   <li>     Pro-people fulfils the aspirations of the society as well as individuals.</li>

       <li> Pro-active in anticipation and response to citizen needs.</li>

            The majority of the total population in India is living in rural areas. Agriculture is considered as the only source of primary occupation as a huge size of rural population of the country is solely dependent on agriculture. Thus the development of rural areas should receive top priority in our development programmes. Accordingly, it requires development of agriculture, implementation of land reform measures and development of cooperatives.
<br><br>
<b>Plantation Crops</b>
<br>
<ul>

       <li><b> Tea: </b> India is second largest producer after China and largest consumer of tea in the world and accounts for about 27% of world production and 13% of the world trade. Export of tea is around 20% of domestic production.</li>

        <li><b>Coffee:</b> Although India contributes only 4% of the world production, Indian coffee has created a niche for itself in the international market, particularly Indian Robustas, which is highly preferred for their good blending quality. Arabica coffee from India is also well received in the international market.</li>

        <li><b>Natural rubber:</b> Rubber is primarily produced in the state of Kerala and adjoining Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, the traditional rubber growing areas of the country. Rubber is also produced in Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Goa and coastal Karnataka.</li>
</ul>
<b>Horticulture:</b>

            The country’s horticulture production rose by 5 percent to touch an all-time high of 300 million tonnes during 2016-17 on the back of record output of record output of fruits, vegetables, spices and plantation crops.
            <br><br>
            According to government data, area under horticulture crops increased by 2.6 percent to 25.1 million hectares in 2016-17, up 3.9 percent from the previous year.
            <br><br>
            A Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture in North-Eastern region including Sikkim was approved with an outlay of 229.38crore for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. The implementation of the scheme has been extended to the States of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the Tenth plan with an additional outlay of 260.00 crore. The scheme aims at establishing convergence and synergy among numerous ongoing governmental programmes through horizontal and vertical integration of these programmes, to ensure adequate, appropriate, timely and concurrent attention to all the links in the production, post-harvest and consumption chain. During 2006-07, an amount of 157.50 crore was released, out of which 81.86 crore was for NE States and 75.63 crore for Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
<br><br>
<b>National Horticulture Mission:</b>

            The Department of agriculture and Cooperation has launched a Centrally-sponsered scheme called National Horticulture Mission (NHM) during 2005-06 for holistic development of this sector ensuring horizontal and vertical linkages with the active participation of all the stakeholders. The Mission’s objectives are: enhance horticulture production through area-based regionally differentiated strategies: improve nutritional security and income support to farm households; establish convergence and synergy among ongoing programmes for horticulture development; and, promote, develop and disseminate technologies.

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>FOOD MANAGEMENT IN INDIA</h3><hr>


            <b>Food management in India has three basic objectives:</b>
            <ul>

        <li>Procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices,</li>

        <li>Distribution of food grains to the consumers particularly the vulnerable sections of the society at affordable prices, and</li>

       <li> Maintenance of food buffers for food security and price stability. The instruments for food management are the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Central Issue Price (CIP).</li>
</ul>
The focus is on incentivising farmers by ensuring fair value for their produce through minimum support price mechanism, distribution of food grains at subsidised rates to 6.52 crore BPL families covering all household under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), establishing grain banks in chronically food scarce areas and strengthening the Public Distribution System (PDS). The nodal agency which undertakes the procurement and distribution and storage of food grains is the Food Corporation of India (FCI).
<br>
The procurement under the current system is open-ended at MSP, while the distribution is governed by the scale of allocation and its off take by the beneficiaries.
<br>
The scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) is in operation since 1997, under which food grains are procured and distributed by the State Governments themselves. Under this scheme, the designated States procure, store and also issue food grains under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). The difference between the economic cost of the State Government and the Central Issue Price is passed on to the state Government as subsidy. The decentralised system of procurement helps to cover more farmers under the MSP operations, improves efficiency of the PDS, provides food grain varieties more suited to local taste and reduces the transportation costs of the FCI.
<br>

<b>Food stocks are maintained by the Central Government for the purposes:</b>
<br>
<ul>
        <li>Meeting the prescribed minimum buffer stock norms for food security.</li>

        <li>For monthly release of food grains for supply through PDS (Public Distribution System).</li>

        <li>For market intervention to augment supply so as to help moderate the open market prices.</li>
</ul>
<b>National Food Security Mission:</b>

            The Department of agriculture and cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, has launched a Centrally sponsored scheme on National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in pursuance of the resolution of the National Development Council (NDC) to increase the production of rice, wheat and pulses by 10, 8 and 2 million tonnes, respectively, over the benchmark levels of production, by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year plan period. The Mission, which has been launched from Rabi 2007-08, aims at increasing food grains production of the above crops through area expansion and productivity; creating employment opportunity; and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers of targeted districts.
<br>
Various activities of NFSM relate to demonstration of improved production technology, distribution of quality seeds of HYVs and hybrids, popularisation of newly released varieties, support for micronutrients, and training and mass media campaign including awards for best performing districts. The identified districts are given flexibility to adopt any local area specific intervention as are included in the Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) prepared for the agriculture development of the district. 2 crore each will be provided during the Eleventh Five-Year plan period to those districts which have a programme for any one of crops. The mission covers 312 districts in 17 states and has become operational from Rabi 2007-08. Under the NFSM, initial reports indicate an increase in wheat seed distribution from 43% in Rajsthan to as high as 10 times in Bihar. In pulses also, the increase in use of improved seed range from 29% in Rajsthan to more than 400% in Chhatishgarh. Focused and target oriented technological intervention under NFSM has made significant impact since to inception, reflected in the increase in production of rice and wheat in 2008-09.<br>

<b>Major Producing States</b>
<ul>
        <li><b>Food grains:</b> Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal</li>

        <li><b>Wheat:</b> Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Rice:</b> West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Coarse Cereals:</b> Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajsthan and Uttar Pradesh</li>

        <li><b>Pulses:</b> Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajsthan</li>
</ul>
<b>Commercial Crops</b><br>

            Commercial Crops are those crops which are produced for trade purpose and earning money and not for self-consumption by the farmers. These commercial crops include:
            <ul>
        <li><b>Oilseed crops:</b> Groundnut, Mustard, Sesame, Rapeseed, Linseed, Castor, Sunflowers, Niger seed and Soybean.</li>

        <li><b>Sugar crops:</b> Sugarcane and Beat</li>

        <li><b>Narcotic crop:</b> Tobacco</li>
        <li><b>Beverage crops:</b> Tea, Coffee</li>
      </ul>
<b>TRIFED:</b>

            The Government established TRIFED (Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd.) in August 1987, The basic aim of TRIFED was to save tribals from exploitation by private traders and to offer them remunerative prices for their minor forest produce and surplus agriculture products. TRIFED started functioning since April 1988. TRIFED has also been declared an important agency for collecting, processing, storing and developing of oil seed products. TRIFED plays a role of an agent of FCI for Government purchase of wheat and rice. It is also an agent of agriculture and cooperation department for Government purchase of cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Agriculture Ministry gives aid to TRIFED for compensating loss incurred due to price fluctuations.<br>

<b>NAFED:</b>

            NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd.) has been established in cooperative sector at national level for marketing of agriculture products.
            Agricultural Marketing<br>

            Organised marketing of agricultural commodities has been promoted in the country through a network of regulated markets. Most of the State Governments and Union Territories have enacted legislation (APMC Act) to provide for regulation of agriculture produce markets. While by the end of 1950, there were 286 regulated markets in the country, but as on March 31, 2009 the number stands at 7,139. Besides the country has 20,868 rural periodical markets, about 15% of which function under the ambit of regulation. The advent of regulated markets has helped in mitigating the market handicaps of producers/sellers at the wholesale assembling level. But, the rural periodic markets in general, and the tribal markets in particular, remained out of the development ambit of APMC Act.
            <br>
            Agriculture sector needs well functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural areas of the country. In order to inject dynamism and efficiency into the marketing system, large investments are required for the development of post-harvest and cold chain infrastructure nearer to the farmer’s field. A major portion of this investment is expected from the private sector, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment is necessary. Alongside, enabling policies need to be put in place to encourage procurement of agricultural commodities directly from farmers’ field and to establish effective linkage between the farm production and the retail chain and food processing industries. Accordingly, amendment to the State APMC Act for deregulation of marketing system in the country is suggested to promote investment in marketing infrastructure, motivating corporate sector to undertake direct marketing and to facilitate a national integrated market.
            <br>

<b>Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act:</b>

            The Government of India has circulated model legislation titled “The State Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) act, 2003 to bring about reforms in agricultural marketing contract farming, direct marketing and public-private partnership in management and development of agricultural markets are the major instruments of change among others.

            Twenty-five States/UTs have already amended their Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts and made varying provisions for the purpose while the remaining states are in the process of amending their respecting APMC Acts.<br>

<b>Agricultural Holding:</b>

            The average size of holding in India is continuously decreasing due to rapid and high population growth. The continuous division and fragmentation of holdings has increased the number of holdings, obviously of smaller size. According to the results of Agriculture Census 1990-91, the total number of operational holdings in the country had increased from 972 million in 1985-86 to 1,066million in 1990-91. Operated area, on the other hand, had risen only marginally, i.e., by about 0.65. Rise in number of holdings without corresponding increase in area clearly showed pressure of population on land with average size of holding declining from 1.69 hectare in 1985-86 to 1.55 hectare in 1990-91. 59% of total operational holdings in 1990-91 were of size less than 1 hectare (i.e. marginal holdings), 32.2% of size between 1-4 hectares (i.e. small holdings). 7.25 of size between 4-10 hectares (i.e. medium holdings) and only 1.6% of size more than 10 hectares (i.e. large holdings)
<br>
            In 1985-86, Rajasthan was having the highest average holding size of 4.34 hectares, followed by Punjab having an average size of 3.77 hectares. Contrary to it, Kerala was having the lowest average holding size of 0.36 hectares (1985-86 data are the latest).<br>

<b>New National Agricultural Policy:</b>

            Union Government has announced new National Agricultural Policy in the Parliament on July 28, 2000. This policy has been planned under the provisions of World Trade Organisation so as to face the challenges of agriculture sector. This policy gives emphasis on promoting agricultural exports after fulfilling domestic demand. The salient features of this policy are:
<ul>

        <li>4% growth rate p.a. for the next two decades.</li>

        <li>Land reforms to provide land to poor farmers.</li>

        <li>Consolidation of holdings in all states of the nation.</li>

        <li>Promoting private investments in agriculture.</li>

        <li>To provide insurance umbrella for crops to farmers.</li>

        <li>To promote biotechnology.</li>

        <li>Promoting research for developing new varieties and ensuring protection to the developed varieties.</li>
</ul>
<b>New Agriculture Policy has been described as ‘Rainbow Revolution’ which includes the following revolutions:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Green (Food grain Production)</li>

        <li>White (Milk)</li>

        <li>Yellow (Oil seeds)</li>

        <li>Blue (Fisheries)</li>

        <li>Golden (Fruits-Apple)</li>

        <li>Grey (Fertiliser)</li>

        <li>Black/Brown (Non-conventional Energy Sources)</li>

        <li>Silver (Eggs)</li>

        <li>Round (Potato)</li>
</ul>
<b>The above Rainbow Revolution also includes ‘Food Chain Revolution’ to put a check on destroying food grains, vegetables and fruits.</b><br>

<b>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana:</b>

            The new Crop Insurance Scheme is in line with One Nation-One Scheme theme. It incorporates the best features of all previous schemes and at the same time, all previous shortcomings/weakness have been removed. The PMFBY will replace the existing two Schemes National Agricultural Insurance scheme as well as the Modified NAIS.<br>

<b>Highlights of the scheme</b>
<ul>
      <li>  There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%. The premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low and balance premium will be paid by the Government to provide full insured amount to the farmers against crop loss on account of natural calamities.</li>

      <li>  There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.</li>

       <li> Earlier, there was a provision of capping the premium rate which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This capping was done to limit Government outgo on the premium subsidy. This capping has now been removed and farmers will get claim against full sum insured without any reduction.</li>

       <li> The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent. Smart phones will be used to capture and upload data of crop cutting to reduce the delays in claim payment to farmers. Remote sensing will be used to reduce the number of crop cutting experiments.</li>

       <li> PMFBY is a replacement scheme of NAIS/MNAIS, there will be exemption from Service tax liability of all the services involved in the implementation of the scheme. It is estimated that the new scheme will ensure about 75-80 percent of subsidy for the farmers in insurance premium.</li>

<b>Fisheries:</b>

            Indian fisheries and aquaculture is an important sector of food production, providing nutritional security to the food basket, contributing to the agricultural exports and engaging about fourteen million people in different activities.
            <br><br>
            The National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) has been set up to realise the untapped potential of the fishery sector with the application of modern tools of research and development including biotechnology. The board was registered in July 2006 under the Andhra Pradesh Societies Registration Act, 2001, and has become operational.
            <br><br>
            The geographic base of Indian marine fisheries has 8,118 km coastline, 2.02 million sq. km of Exclusive Economic Zone including 0.5 million sq. km of continental shelf and 3,937 fishing villages. There are 189 traditional fish landing centres, 59 minor fishing harbours and 6 major fishing harbours, which serve as bases for about 2,80,000 fishing craft consisting of 1,81,000 non-motorised traditional craft 45,000 motorised traditional craft and 54,000 mechanised boats. Out of 180 deep sea fishing vessels, only 60 are in operation at present. National Fisheries Development Board has been set up to realise the untapped potential of fishery sector with the application of modern tools of research and development including biotechnology.
            <br><br>
            The Board was registered in July 2006 under Andhra Pradesh Society Registration Act, 2001 and has become operational. The Coastal agricultural Authority Bill, 2005 passed by both Houses of Parliament became an Act on June 23, 2005. Rules have already been framed under the Act.<br>
            <br>
<b>Price Stabilisation Fund Scheme:</b>

            Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) refers to any fund constituted for the purpose of containing extreme volatility in prices of selected commodities. The amount in the fund is generally utilised for activities aimed at bringing down/up the high/low prices say for instance, procurement of such products and distribution of the same as and when required, so that prices remain in a range.
            <br><br>
            Many countries use such dedicated for stabilisation of major petroleum product prices, particularly if they are importers. Some countries use such funds for stabilising not just commodity prices but a variety of key macroeconomic variables such as the exchange rate (which is nothing but the price of the domestic currency expressed in terms of an external currency), benchmark stock indices etc. The operational details of such funds vary from country to country.
            <br><br>
            India first created a price stabilisation fund for some export oriented plantation crops in 2003, and this ceased to exist in 2013. Another fund was created in 2015 for perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities, but initially limited to support potato and onion prices only.
            <br><br>
            A Price Stabilisation Found of Rs. 500 crores for agricultural commodities was announced in the Union Budget 2014-15 with a view to mitigate volatility in the prices of agricultural produce.
            <br><br>
            Accordingly, the Government of India, on 27 March 2015, approved the creation of a Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) with a corpus of Rs. 500 crores as a Central Sector Scheme, to support market interventions for price control of perishable agri-horticulture commodities during 2014-15 to 2016-17. Initially the fund was proposed to be used for market interventions for onion and potato only and pulses were added subsequently.<br>

Industrialisation has come to be regarded as synonymous with economic development. The essential criteria that are being used to distinguish a developed economy from an underdeveloped one relate to the proportion of workforce engaged in industrial activity, the proportion of national output originating in the industrial sector, etc.
<ul>

        <li>Adoption of technologically superior techniques of production that help to transform basic raw material and intermediate goods into manufacture goods, and</li>

       <li> Application of modern techniques of management and organisation like economic calculation, accountancy, etc. Since technological progress is a necessary condition for fast economic growth, it is necessary to know about Appropriate Technology and Intermediate Technology.</li>
</ul>
<b>Industrial policy resolution, 1948</b>

This policy divided the industries into four broad categories:
<ul>
        <li><b>State monopolies:</b> This first category included the manufacture of arms and ammunition, the production and control of atomic energy and the ownership of railways. This category would belong to the exclusive monopoly of the Central Government.</li>

        <li><b>Basic industries:</b> The second category included coal, iron and steel, shipbuilding, aircrafts and telephones. New plants in these industries would be taken only by the Government.</li>

        <li><b>Regulated industries:</b> The third category included certain basic industries such as automobiles, tractors, heavy machinery, machine tools, cement, sugar, etc. The Government of India would regulate these industries because of the importance of these industries.</li>

        <li><b>Private industries:</b> The last category included all the other industries except the above. These industries were open to private sector.</li>
</ul>
This Industrial Policy Resolution also stressed the importance of cottage and small scale industries. Though the resolution felt the necessity of foreign capital, yet it wanted to regulate foreign capital. The Resolution stressed the importance of progressive Indianisation of foreign concerns. It also appealed for healthy labour-management relations. This policy outlined a mixed economy for India.
<br>
<b>New Industrial Policy, 1991:</b>

      A series of sweeping changes were announced by the Government in the form of New Industrial Policy on July 24, 1991. The basic philosophy of the new policy has been the attainment of international competitiveness and liberalisation of the industrial sector.
<br>
<b>Objectives</b><br>

<b>The New Industrial Policy seeks to achieve the following objectives.</b>
<ul>
        <li>To consolidate the strength build-up during the last four decades of economic planning and to build on the gain already made.</li>

        <li>To correct the distortions or weakness that may have crept in the industrial structure as it has developed over the last four decades.</li>

        <li>To maintain a sustained growth in the productivity and gainful employment.</li>

        <li>To attain international competitiveness.</li>
</ul>
<b>The pursuit of these objectives will be tempered by:</b><br>

 &rarr;  The need to preserve the environment, and<br>

 &rarr;  The need to ensure the efficient use of available resources.<br>

<b>In pursuit of the above objectives, Government has decided to take a series of initiatives in respect of the policies relating to the following areas:</b><br>

<b>Industrial Licensing Policy</b>
  <ul>
        <li>Industrial licensing has been abolished for all projects except for a short list of industries related to security and strategic concerns, social reasons, hazardous chemicals and overriding environmental reasons, and items of luxurious consumption.</li>

        <li>Only six industries groups where security and strategic concerns predominate are under the purview of industrial licensing.                                                       These are: alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, electronics, aerospace and defence equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals and industrial explosive.</li>

&rarr;   Where foreign exchange availability is ensured through foreign equity.<br>

&rarr;   If the CIF value of imported capital goods required is less than 25% of the total value of plant and equipment, upto maximum value of 2 crore.<br>

       <li>In locations other than cities of more than million population, there will be no requirements of obtaining industrial approvals from the Central Government except for industries subject to compulsory licensing.</li>
</ul>
<b>List of Industries Requiring compulsory Industrial Licensing</b>
  <ul>
      <li> Distillation and brewing of alcoholic drinks.</li>

       <li>Cigars and cigarettes of tobacco manufactured tobacco substitute.</li>

       <li>Electronic aerospace and defence equipment, all types.</li>

       <li>Industrial explosives including detonating fuses, safety fuses, gun powder, nitrocellulose and matches.</li>

       <li>Hazardous chemicals.</li>

       <li>Drugs and pharmaceuticals (according to the modifies Drug Policy in September, 1994 and subsequently amended in February, 1999).</li>
</ul>
<b>Competition Policy:</b>

       In order to improve competition and thus contain the distortions caused by monopoly power, the competition Act, 2002 has been enacted in December, 2002. It is a landmark legislation that aims at promoting competition through prohibition of anticompetitive practices, abuse of dominance and through regulation of companies beyond a particular size. This Act will replace the MRTP Act. This Act provides for the establishment of a Competition Commission of India which was established on October 14, 2003.
       <br>

<b>Companies (Amendment) Act, 2002:</b>

       This legislation will provide primary producers a new kind of organisation, i.e. a producer company to produce and market the products in a modern and professional manner at par with other companies. It will enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of cooperatives, and enable then to compete and operate in today’s liberalised, globalised market.<br>

 

 

<b>Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002:</b>

        The Act provides for the constitution of a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The functions that are presently being handed by the Company Law Board (CLB) (dispute resolution and compliance with certain provisions of the Companies Act, 1956), Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) (revival and rehabilitation of sick companies) and High Courts (winding up of companies) will now be handled by the NCLT, once the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provision) Act, 1985 (SICA) is repeated.

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>PRIVATIZATION</h3><hr>

<b>Meaning of Privatisation</b>

        The word privatisation, no doubt, has different meaning to different persons but literally it means holding of a firm/business in personal risk or the sole controlling body is not an authorising body of governmental departments. But in an authorising body of governmental departments. But in India, the word privatisation stands for the disinvestment of governments equity in PSUs and the opening up of hitherto closed areas to private participation.

       Privatisation refers to any process that reduces the involvement of the State/Public sector in economic activities of a nation. The privatisation process in a mixed economy of India includes.
<br>

   <b>    Denationalisation.</b><br>
<ul>
     <li>  Entry of private sector industries into the areas exclusively reserved for the State sector or which are considered exclusively reserved for the State sector or which are considered exclusive monopolies of State.</li>

       <li>Transfer of management and control of public sector undertakings and activities managed departmentally, e.g. railways, steel, posts and telegraphs, etc. to the private sector. It can take place through different techniques like:</li>

&rarr;   Franchising, whereby ownership would be private but the brand name and technical know-how would be provided by the public sector,

&rarr;   Contracting out a government service,

&rarr;   Leasing out physical facilities to private operators, and

&rarr;   Disinvestment through equity sales.

       <li>Limiting the scope of the public sector or no more diversification of existing public sector undertakings.</li>
</ul>
<b>Attempts of Privatisation in India</b><br>

      <b>The new Industrial Policy announced by the Government of India in July 1991 emphasised the following four measures to reform the public sector enterprises:</b>
<ul>
       <li>Reduction in the number of reserved industry for public sector: Now only 3 industries are reserved exclusively for the public sector.</li>

       <li>Policy regarding sick PSUs to be the same as that for private sector: The 1991 Industrial Policy sector not at par with the private sector units.  Now the public sector units have also been brought within the jurisdiction of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).</li>

      <li> <b>Memorandum of Undertaking (MoU):</b> The main objective of MoU is to reduce the quantity of control and increase the quality of accountability. Over the years, the MoU system has grown at a steady rate, from 4 MoUs in 1987-88 to 99 in 2004-05. On the basis of the MoU performance evaluation carried for the year 2004-05 the number of excellent rated PSEs was 42.33 PSEs were rated as very good.</li>
</ul>
<b>MoU for PSUs:</b>

      The Government on the recommendations of the “committee to review the policy for the public enterprises” (Arjun Sengupta Committee 1985) has entered into Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) with a number of PSUs. The real purpose of MoU is to manage PSEs by management by objectives rather than management by control. For the first time, since the inception of public sector, an attempt has been made to free them from the administrative control of the ministries and permit them to operate autonomously in a competitive environment.

     <b>The major plank of the privatisation in India has been the disinvestments of government equity in a select number of profit-making public enterprises.</b>

<br> 

<b>Objectives of Disinvestment</b>
<ul>
       The overall objective of the disinvestments policy is to raise resources from within the public sector for meeting the following categories of costs associated with the transforming of the Indian Public sector.

      <li> A part of these resources will be used to pay for the cost associated with the closure of enterprises declared as terminally sick by BIFR. These costs would primarily include expenses relating to voluntary retirement schemes.</li>

       <li>A big part of money raised from disinvestments will be used for retraining of the workers displaced or affected as a result of the closure and internal restructuring involving downsizing.</li>

       <li>The main rationale behind disinvestments is to raise non-inflationary form of finance for the budget, all other objectives are subsidiary to this main objectives.</li>
</ul>
<b>Methodology of Disinvestment:</b>

       The government does not seem to have a clear policy on the methodology of disinvestments. The Government followed the policy of open auction sale and allowed NRIs and other persons legally permitted to hold equity to participate. But later in 1999-2000 the Government shifted to strategic sale. But it is intriguing that in case of BPCL, Government adopted the public offering methodology and in case of HPCL to a strategic investor.
       <br>

<b>Rangarajan Committee on PSU Disinvestment, 1993:</b>

       The Government appointed a Committee under the chairmanship of Shirt C. Rangarajan to recommend fresh modalities for undertaking disinvestment. The committee submitted its Report to the Government in June, 1993.<br>

       <b>The major recommendation of the Committee can be summarised as follows:</b>
<ul>
      <li> The Government should identify the public sector unit in which the equity should be disinvested.</li>

       <li>The Government should retain majority equity control in PSUs operating in strategically important areas like defence and atomic energy. In the rest of PSUs, the government could disinvest up to any level.</li>

     <li>  Workers interest should be protected in the event of disinvestment. Employees of the disinvested PSUs should also be allowed to buy share</li>.

       <li>A transparent mechanism for disinvesting PSU shares is called for.</li>

       <li>An autonomous agency with total responsibility for off loading government shares in the identified PSUs be set-up.</li>
</ul>
<b>In August, 1996, a five member Disinvestment Commission was set up. The

Commission was headed by G.V.Ramkrishna, a former Planning Commission member and a former Chairman of SEBI. Apart from drawing out a detailed disinvestment strategy, the Commission also referred:</b>
<ul>
       <li> To draw a long-term disinvestment programme within 5 to 10 years for the PSUs</li>.

        <li>To determine the extent of disinvestment in each PSUs.</li>

        <li>To private PSUs referred to it by the core group in terms of overall disinvestment programmes.</li>

        <li>To recommend the preferred modes of disinvestment.</li>

        <li>To select the financial advisors for the specified PSUs to facilitate the disinvestment process.</li>

        <li>To supervise the overall sale process and take decisions on the instruments as well as the pricing.</li>

        <li>To ensure that appropriate measures are taken during the disinvestment process to protect the interest of employees.</li>

      In the mixed economy, along with the private and the joint sector, the growth of the cooperative sector too has been encouraged as a part of the State’s economic policy. The first Plan envisaged the cooperative sector to cover a number of vital areas like agriculture, rural and small-scale industry, retail distribution, housing, etc.
<br><br>
      <b>The important objectives of the development of the cooperative sector have been as follows:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Prevention of concentration of economic power;</li>

        <li>Wider dispersal of ownership of productive resources;</li>

        <li>Active involvement of people in the development programmes;</li>

        <li>Augmentation of the productive resources;</li>

        <li>Liquidation of unemployment and poverty, etc.</li>
</ul>
      <b>One of the important aspects of the development of the cooperative sector in India, as in other countries, is the State participation. The important ways by which the state patronises the cooperative sector in India are as follows:</b>
<ul>
       <li> State partnership in the share capital of cooperatives,</li>

        <li>Loans to societies,</li>

        <li>Subsidies and grants,</li>

       <li> Guarantee,</li>

        <li>Contribution to sick fund,</li>

        <li>Tax concessions,</li>

        <li>Legal concessions and sanctions,</li>

        <li>Training and education,</li>

        <li>Assistance to the Reserve Bank and other organisations that help cooperatives, and</li>

        <li>Arrangements for training and education of personnel.</li>
</ul>

      However, in spite of State patronage, the growth of the cooperative sector in industry has been rather slow. Its growth has been inhibited largely due to powerful vested interests.

      <b>Enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006.</b>
<ul>
   <li>Amendment to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act, 1956 introducing several new features to facilitate professionalism in the operations of the Commission as well as field-level formal and  structured consultations with all segments of stakeholders. The new Commission has been constituted.</li>

        <li>A package for Promotion of Micro and Small Enterprises has been approved recently to address most of the concerns in the areas such as credit, cluster-based development, infrastructure, technology and marketing. Capacity building of MSME Associations and support to women entrepreneurs are the other important features of this package.</li>

       <li> An Empowered Group of Minister (EGoM) under the Chairmanship of the External Affairs Minister has been set-up to lay down a comprehensive policy for cluster-development and oversee its implementation.</li>

      <b>The ‘small sector’, as the name implies, consists of small-scale industries. In the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 and 1956, the small sector was given special role for creating additional employment with low capital investment. Following Dhar and Lydall, we can divide the small-scale industries into following three categories:</b>
<ul>
      <li> <b> Cottage industries:</b> These are generally associated with agriculture and part-time and whole-time occupations in rural and semi-urban areas.</li>

       <li> <b>Agro-based industries:</b> These industries are based on the processing of agricultural produce, or they cater to the input needs of the agriculturist. Agro-based industries may be organised on a</li>

  &rarr; cottage scale,<br>

  &rarr; <li>small scale, or<br>

  &rarr; <li>large scale.<br>
</ul>
Large-scale, agro-based industries are generally set up in large cities, or in semi-urban areas. Rural agro-based industries are generally organised either on a cottage or small-scale basis and possess most of their characteristics.

        <li><b>Small-scale industries:</b> We can distinguish between two types of small industries:</li>
<ul>
&rarr; <b> Modern small-scale manufacturing enterprises:</b> These are small-firms using “modern techniques to produce modern product”.<br>

&rarr;  <b>Intermediate group of small enterprises:</b> These firms use more or less traditional techniques to produce more or less modern products.<br>
</ul>
<b>Cottage Industry and Small Industries</b><br>

      We can distinguish between these two types on the basis of their links with the rest of the system rather than in terms of their absolute size or technological considerations alone. These links are of the technical or input-output kind as well as of the general economic kind. Small industries are technically and economically connected with large-scale sector which the cottage industries generally are not.<br>

<b>Small Industry and Large Industry</b><br>

      The difference between the small and the large industries arises largely because of the distinct organisational character of the former which is indicated by such factors as ownership, management, technique, flow of inputs and output, localisation and finally the historic sequence of development. In the official industrial policy formulation, as small industry is defined as a unit having investment up to 60 lakh in plant and machinery.
<br>
      To step up credit to the unorganised sector, the commission suggested that micro enterprises should be provided credit at an interest rate of 7% on loans up to 3 lakh.
<br>
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006
<br>
      Small and Medium Enterprises Development Bill, 2005 (which was introduced in the Parliament on May 12, 2005) has been approved by the President and thus become an Act. This new Act, 2006, has become effective from October 2, 2006. This Act makes a different category for medium level enterprises.

       <li> The Act provides for a statutory consultative mechanism at the national level with wide representation of all sections of stakeholders, particularly the three classes of enterprises, and with a wide range of advisory functions, and an Advisory Committee to assist the Board and the Centre/State Governments.</li>

        <li><b>The other features include:</b></li>

&rarr;  establishment of specific funds for the promotion, development and enhancement of competitiveness of these enterprises,<br>

&rarr;  notification of schemes/programmes for this purpose,<br>

&rarr;  progressive credit policies and practices,<br>

&rarr;  preference in Government procurements to products and services of the micro and small enterprises,<br>

&rarr;  more effective mechanisms for mitigating the problems of delayed payments to micro and small enterprises, and<br>

      The objective of the National Manufacturing Policy is to boost the country’s share of industrial production, employment; development of world class infrastructure and augment investments in India’s manufacturing space.
<br>
<b>Summary of the Policy</b>
<ul>
        <li>Manufacturing’s share in India’s GDP has been stuck at 16% since the 1980s. The policy aims to increase the share of manufacturing in the country’s GDP from the current 16% to 25% by 2022.</li>

       <li> The National Manufacturing Policy aims to create 100 million additional jobs in the next decade.</li>

        <li>The draft policy envisages establishment of National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) equipped with world-class infrastructure that would be autonomous and self-regulated and developed in partnership with the private sector.</li>

        <li>Each National Investment and Manufacturing Zone to have 5,000 hectares.</li>

        <li>Land will be selected by State Governments. Preference would be given to uncultivable land.</li>

        <li>Both state and central Government would fund trunk infrastructure.</li>

        <li>The policy embodies an easy exit policy and single window clearance in Zones.</li>

        <li>The NIMZ would be managed by special entity.</li>

        <li>The policy has envisaged fiscal sops to boost manufacturing,</li>

        <li>Small and medium enterprises to be reimbursed for technology purchase.</li>

        <li>Industrial training and skills development programmes.</li>

        <li>Flexible labour laws and simplified and expeditious exit mechanism for sick units.</li>

        <li>Relaxation in environmental regulations.</li>

        <li>Financial and tax incentives to small and medium enterprises.</li>

        <li>Incentives to states for infrastructure development.</li>

        <li>Incentives for Green Manufacturing.</li>

       <li> Rationalisation of business regulations to reduce burden of procedural and regulatory compliance on businesses.</li>

        <li>Increased focus on employment intensive industries, capital goods industry, industries with strategic significance and those in which India enjoy a competitive edge and the SME sector.</li>

       <li> Make industrial land (land acquisition) available through creation of land banks by states.</li>
</ul>
<b>National Investment and Manufacturing Zones</b>
<ul>
        <li>National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs) will be developed as integrated industrial townships with state-of-the art infrastructure and land use on the basis of zoning, clean and energy efficient technology, necessary social infrastructure, skill development facilitates, etc., to provide a productive environment to persons transitioning from the primary sector to the secondary and tertiary sectors.</li>

        <li>These NIMZs would be managed by SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) which would ensure master planning of the Zone; pre-clearances for setting up the industrial units to be located within the zone and undertake such other functions as specified in the various sections of this policy.</li>

        <li>To enable the NIMZ to function as a self-governing and autonomous body, it will declared by the State Government as an Industrial Township under Article 243O(c) of the Constitution.</li>

<li>In sum, the NIMZs would be large areas of developed land, with the requisite ecosystem for promoting world class manufacturing activity.</li>

<b>Indian Money Market:</b>

            Money Market refers to a mechanism whereby on the one hand borrowers manage to obtain short-term loanable funds and on the other; lenders succeed in getting credit worthy borrowers for their money. In any money market, commercial banks are the most important lenders. These banks are, however, not merely the lenders of money, they also create credit. The central banks role is important as the controller of credit. The Indian money market is not an integrated unit. It is broadly divided into two parts, viz. the unorganised and the organised.
<br><br>
<b>Unorganised Sector of the Indian Money Market</b><br>

            Unregulated non-bank financial intermediaries such as fanince companies, chit funds, nidhis, etc. indigenous banlers and moneylenders operate in the unorganised sector of the Indian money market. Lendings of the  moneylender are rather small, but some finance companies, chit funds and indigenous bankers do a considerable amount of business. They pursue banking business on traditional lines. Some of them are:
<br>
            Unregulated non-bank financial intermediaries: Loan companies (also called finance companies) are found in all parts of the country. The exact members of Loan Companies are not known. In addition, a large number of partnership firms and individuals are engaged in lending business. The chit funds are savings institutions. They are of various types lacking any standardised form. A chit fund has regular members who make periodical subscriptions to the fund. The nidhis operate particularly in South India. They are in their characters as some kind of mutual benefit funds because their dealings are restricted only to the members.
<br>
            Indigenous bankers: Indigenous bankers are individuals or private firms which receive deposits and give loans and thereby operate as banks. Over the past four decades, the indigenous bankers have faced stiff competition from the commercial and cooperative banks. These bankers unwilling to separate their banking and non-banking activities.<br>
<br>
            <b>Moneylenders:</b> Moneylenders do not constitute one homogenous category. Broadly, they are of two types:
            <ul>

        <li>Professional moneylenders whose main activity is moneylending, and</li>

       <li> Non-professional moneylenders whose source of income is not moneylending.</li>
</ul>
The methods of operation of the moneylenders are not uniforms and their activities are generally localised.
<br>
<b>Organised Sector of the Indian Money Market:</b><br>

            The modern sector of the Indian money market is reasonably well-organised and integrated. Leaving aside some highly developed financial centers, the organised sector of the Indian money market is far more organised sector of the Indian money market is far more organised and developed than the money markets in most of the countries. The organised sector of the Indian money market comprises the RBI, commercial banks, foreign banks, cooperative banks, finance corporations, mutual funds and the Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) Limited. Broadly the principal constituents of the organised sector of the Indian money market are:
<br>
            <b>The call money market:</b> The call money market exists in almost all developed money markets. It is generally the most sensitive part of the financial system. Any change in flow of funds and the demand for them is clearly reflected in it.
<br>
            <b>The treasury bill market:</b> The market which deals in treasury bills is known as the treasury bill market. In India, treasury bills are short-term liability of the central government. Some important treasury bills which have been used in the recent days are: 14-Day Intermediate Treasury Bill,14-Day Auction Treasury Bills, 91-Day Treasury Bills, 182-Day Treasury Bills, 364-Day Treasury Bills.
<br>
            <b> The repo market:</b> Repo is a money market instrument which helps in collateralised short-term borrowing and lending through sale/purchase operations in debt instruments. Repo is the rate at which banks borrow from the Reserve Bank, while reverse repo is used to drain excess cash lying with the banks.
<br>
            <b>The commercial bill market:</b> The commercial bill market is the sub-market in which the trade bills or the commercial bills are handled. The commercial bill is a bill drawn by one Merchant firm. On the other generally commercial bills arise out of domestic transactions. The legitimate purpose of a commercial bill is to reimburse the seller while the buyer delays payment.<br>

            <b>The certificate of deposit market:</b> A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a   certificate issued by a bank to depositors of funds that remain on deposit at the bank for a specified period. Thus, CDS are tradable in the short-term money markets.RBI introduced CDs with the objective of widening the range of money market instruments and to provide investors greater flexibility in the deployment of their short-term surplus funds.
<br>
            <b>The commercial paper market:</b> The Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term instrument of raising funds by corporate. It is essentially a sort of unsecured promissory note sold by the issuer to a banker or a security house. On the basis of the recommendation of Vaghul Committee, it was introduced in the Indian Money Market in January 1990. The CP can be issued by a listed Company which has a working Capital of not less than 5 crores.
            <br>

<b>Commercial Banking in India:</b>

            At the time of independence, Indian banking system was not sound. There were hundreds of private banks under unscrupulous management. Hence, in 1949 two major actions were taken very important from the point of view of structural reforms in the banking sector:

       <li> The Banking Regulation Act was passed. It gave extensive regulatory powers to RBI over the commercial banks.</li>

        <li>The nationalisation of the RBI.</li>

In the two decades following the enactment of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Indian banking system developed in many respects. A significant change that occurred in this period was a steady decline in the importance of the non-scheduled commercial banks. The Banking Regulation Act provided extensive regulatory powers to the RBI and with that it became possible for it to carry out various structural reforms in the banking system.<br>

The establishment of the State Bank of India in 1955 and the creation of the State Bank group by nationalising eight regional banks in 1960 allowed scope for a new experiment in the Indian banking.
<br>
<b>‘Lead Bank’ Scheme and Branch Expansion</b><br>

            The area approach in respect of bank financing proposed by the Gadgil Study Group towards the end of 1969, culminated in the Lead Bank Scheme. It had the backing of Nariman Committee also.
<br>
            The Reserve Bank accepted the recommendations of the Narima Committee and prepared the ‘Lead Bank’ Scheme. Under the ‘Lead Bank’ Scheme districts were allotted to the State Bank Group, 14 nationalised banks and 3 private Indian banks.
<br>
            The Lead Bank was assigned a major development responsibility in the district allotted to it. It was expected to familiarise itself with socio-economic conditions prevailing in the district.<br>

<b>Indian Currency system</b><br>

            Indian monetary system is managed by Reserve Bank of India. It is based on inconvertible paper currency. The internal purposes are met by currency notes and coins. For external purposes it can be converted into foreign currencies.
<br>
<b>Important Terms Related to Currency</b><br>

            <b>Hard currency:</b> A currency traded in a foreign exchange market for which demand is persistently high relative to the supply, e.g. Pound and Euro Dollar.<br>

            <b>Soft currency:</b> A currency whose exchange rate is tending to fall because of persistent balance of payments deficits or because of the building up of speculative selling of currency in expectation of a change in its exchange rate. Governments are unwilling to hold a soft currency in their foreign exchange reserves.<br>

            <b>Reserve currency:</b> A currency which government and international institutions are willing to hold in their gold and foreign exchange reserves and finance as significant proportion of international trade.<br>

            <b>Fiat money:</b> Currency which is legally decreed as valid means of financing transactions. It is legal tender.<br>

            <b>Hot money:</b> Funds which flow into a country to take advantage of favourable rates of interest in that country. They influence the balance of payments and strengthen the exchange rate of the recipient country.<br>

<b>Classifications of Money</b>
<ul>
<b>Various Forms of Credit Money</b>
<ul>
        <li><b>Token coins:</b> All our coins are token coins in the sense that their value as money is far above the value of the metal contained in them.</li>

       <li><b> Representative token money:</b> This is usually of the form of paper, which is in effect a circulating ware house receipt for token coins or an equivalent amount of bullion that is banking it.</li>

       <li><b> Circulating promissory notes issued by central banks:</b> This is the greatest part of modern currency, and includes all currency notes in India issued by the Reserve Bank of India.</li>
</ul>
<b>Reserve Money:</b>

            In simple terms, Reserve Money can be called as government money produced by RBI (RBI is also taken as government) and let by the people and the banks. The reserve money is often called high powered money, basic money, primary money or monetary money. The ability of the banking system to create deposit money depends on the amount of reserve money available and the portion of which public holds in the form of currency. Reserve money is actually the cash held by the public and the banks.
<br>
<b>It is composed of</b>
<ul>
       <li> Currency in circulation-coins and currency notes held by the general public (C);</li>

        <li>Other deposits of the general public with RBI (OD);</li>

        <li>Cash Reserves of banks (CR) which are actually composed of two parts viz.</li>

&rarr;   Cash with banks themselves, and<br>

&rarr;   Bankers’ deposits with RBI (which banks correctly consider as their cash).<br>

<li>Thus, Reserve Money (RM) = C + OD + CR</li>
</ul>
<b>This means that RM is held party by the public (OD) and partly by banks (CR).</b><br><br>

CR is the very base for the entire demand deposit structure of the banking system. There are limits to the volume of credit creation in expansion of deposits; there should be enough cash with the ban king system to meet the depositors’ demand whenever it comes. The banking law requires a certain percentage of the deposits to be as cash reserve. The higher the percentage of cash reserve ratio + deposits required, the smaller the volume of credit creation and deposit expansion. The RBI can influence the volume of bank credit-bank deposits by manipulating the CR. If the whole of C + OD and CR is considered as reserve money, it is because C and OD also the potential of becoming CR without intervention from the RBI; the public could shift part of C into bank deposits or move part of OD into bank deposits.
<br>
<b>Monetary Aggregates</b><br>

            M0 = Currency in Circulation + Bankers Deposits with the RBI + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI.
<br><br>
            M1 = Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI = Currency with the Public + Current Deposits with the Banking System + Demand Liabilities portion of Savings Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI.<br><br>

            M2 = M1 + Time Liabilities portion of Savings Deposits with the Banking System + Certificates of Deposit issued by Banks + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) deposits) with a contractual maturity of up to and including one year with the Banking System = Currency with the Public + Current Deposits with the Banking System + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) Deposits) with a contractual maturity up to and including one year with the Banking System; and
<br><br>
            M3 = M2 + Term Deposits (excluding FCNR (B) Deposits) with a contractual maturity of over one year with the Banking System + Call borrowings from ‘Non-Depository’ Financial Corporations by the Banking System.<br>

            The reserve Bank of India (RBI) was established as a shareholders’ bank on April 1, 1935. It retained this character for about fourteen years. Over this period important developments took place in India. The country got freedom on August 15, 1947, and the nationalist government decided to initiate the process of planned economic development. It was felt that a State-owned central bank was better suited to the requirements of the country. Hence, the RBI was nationalized on January 1, 1949.

<b>Control of credit by the RBI:</b>

            In India, the legal framework of the RBI’s control over the credit structure has been provided under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the Banking Regulation act, 1949. The RBI has been empowered to use almost all the traditional instruments of credit control under the former; the latter has given it additional powers to use some other direct methods of credit regulation.

        <li>Open Market Operation</li>

        <li>The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</li>

        <li>Repos and Reverse Repos</li>
</ul>
<b>The RBI introduced the Repos in the Central Government dated securities in 1992 to even out interest rates in the call money market.</b>
<br>
<b>Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF):</b>

The Liquidity Adjustment facility (LAF) was introduced by the Reserve Bank in June 2000. It allows the Reserve Bank to manage market liquidity on a daily basis and also transmit interest rate signals to the market. The LAF, initially recommended by the Committee of Banking Sector Reforms (under the chairmanship of M. Narasimham), was introduced in stages in consonance with the level of market development and technological advances in payment and settlement systems. The LAF operates through reverse repo auctions, i.e., the sale of government securities from the RBI portfolio for absorption of liquidity and repo auctions i.e., buying of government securities for injection of liquidity on a daily basis, thereby creating a corridor for the call money rates and other short-term interest rates. The LAF has emerged as the principal operating instrument of monetary policy enabling the Reserve Bank to modulates short-term liquidity under varied financial market conditions.
<br>
<b>Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS):</b>

The MSS is an arrangement between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank to mop up the excess liquidity generated on account of the accretion to the foreign exchange assets of the Bank to neutrilize the monetary impact of capital flows.
<br>
            M1 measure represents the most liquid form of money among four money stock measures adopted by RBI. As we proceed from M1 to M4 the liquidity gets reduced. M3 is the most important component among all money stock measures which is generally termed as ‘Broad Money’.
<br>
<b>Marginal Standing Facility (MSF):</b>

            Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) is the rate at which scheduled banks could borrow funds overnight from RBI against approved government securities. Banks can borrow funds through MSF during acute cash shortage (considerable shortfall of liquidity). This measure has been introduced by RBI to regulate short-term asset liability mismatches more effectively. The MSF is pegged 100bps or 1% above the Repo Rate. To provide greater liquidity cushion the RBI introduced MSF. RBI announced the introduction ofMSF in May 2011.

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>MONETARY POLICY TERMS</h3><hr>

<b>Bank rate:</b>

            This is the rate at which central bank (RBI) lends money to other banks or financial institutions. If the bank rate goes up, long-term interest rates also tend to move up, and vice-versa. Thus, it can said that in case bank rate is hiked, in all likelihood banks will hikes their own lending rates to ensure and they continue to make a profit.
            <br>
<b>Monetary policy objectives:</b>

            Going by convention, a central bank has two sets of tools-quantitative and qualitative-to signal easing or tight money conditions, depending on its policy objective. While quantitative tools would include imposing Cash reserve Requirements (CRR) for banks, fixing the repo or reverse-repo rates, the bank rate and prescribing the level of growth in the financial markets, pursuant with its growth objective for the economy. Popular qualitative measures would include imposing margins on certain loans and moral suasion. However, RBI often tweaks only the repo or reverse-repo rates and CRR. CRR is the proportion of deposits banks need to keep with the RBI.<br>

<b>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):</b>

            Banks are required to maintain a part or portion of the deposits they mobilise as cash with the central banks as CRR. Banks are required to park these funds on the average daily deposit mobilised on a fortnightly basis. This measure serves the policy objective instantly as liquidity is either infused or impounded almost immediately. However, this is not a very popular tool with central banks globally, though used by RBI often. Back home, even though SLR (the portion of deposits raised by banks that needs to be parked in government bonds, effectively controlling the amount of lendable funds in the system) is a tool that is in vogue. However, it is not often that RBI revises the SLR. RBI lends to banks at repo rate to manage their daily liquidity.<br>

<b>Repo rate:</b>

            It is essentially a short-term policy signal, the discount rate at which the central bank buys securities from commercial banks and infuses liquidity into the system. In other words, it is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks to manage their daily liquidity. The intent is to signal the cost of funds in the system and indirectly influence the quantum of growth in funds while the bank rate is a signal for long-term rates and is a refinance rate for commercial banks. However, the bank rate has not been revised by RBI for over a decade now. RBI sells securities to banks at reverse-repo rate to suck out excess liquidity from the system.<br>

<b>Reverse-repo rate:</b>

Conversely, reverse-repo is the rate at which the central bank sells securities to banks in order to suck out excess liquidity from the system. If RBI wants to discourage banks from piling up idle cash, it reduces such rates. This will then force banks to look at other options to deploy their funds and earn better returns. Under its current liquidity management strategy, the repo and reverse-repo rates serve as a corridor for the movement of the overnight call money rates for banks. RBI initiated measures to keep the country at bay from the global financial crisis.<br>

<b>Statutory Liquidity Ratio:</b>

Every bank is required to maintain at the close of business every day, a minimum proportion of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities as liquid assets in the form of cash, gold and unencumbered approved securities. The ratio of liquid assets to demand and time liabilities is known as Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). RBI is empowered to increase this ratio upto 40%. An increase in SLR also restricts the bank’s leverage position to pump more money into the economy.<br>

      Capital is often defined as ‘wealth used in the production of further wealth’. In simple words, it comprises the money and the money value invested in a business unit.
<br>
      The market of an economy where funds are transacted between the fund surplus and fund scare individual and groups is known as financial market. Financial markets in every economy are having two separate segments for short-term funds and long-term funds
<br>
      Short-term financial market is known as money market and long-term financial market is known as Capital market<br>
      <b>The securities market is divided into:</b>
<ul>
        <li>The gilt-edged market; and</li>

        <li>The corporate securities market.</li>
</ul>
<b>Gilt-Edged Market:</b>

      The gilt-edged market is the market in government securities or the securities guaranteed (as to both principal and interest) by the government. Since the government cannot default on its payment obligations, the government securities are risk free and hence are known as gilt-edged (which means ‘of the best quality’).
<br>
<b>Difference Between Money and Capital Markets</b><br>
<ul>
        <li>The money market deals in short-term funds which are used for financing current business operations and short-term needs of the government. On the other hand, the capital market deals in long-term funds required by industry and government.</li>

        <li>Short-term funds in the money market refer to a period of less than a year, while in the capital market long-term funds refer to a period up to 25 years.</li>

        <li>The money market uses such instruments as promissory notes, bills of exchange, treasury bills, certificates of deposits, etc. On the other hand, the capital market used long-term securities such as shares, debentures and bonds of industrial concerns and of the government.</li>

        <li>The central bank, commercial banks, non-bank financial intermediaries and bill brokers deal in money market instruments. On the other hand, stock exchanges, mutual funds, leasing companies, investment banks, investment trusts, insurance companies, etc. deal in capital market instruments.</li>
</ul>
<b>Securities and Exchange Board of India</b>

      The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) set up in 1988 was given statutory recognition in 1992 on recommendations of the Narsimham Committe. Amongother things, the SEBI has been mandated to create an environment which would facilities mobilisation of adequate resources through the securities market and its efficient allocation. The  purpose and aims of SEBI are as follows:
<ul>
        <li>Tegulating the business in stock markets and other securities markets;</li>

       <li> Registering and regulating the working of stock brokers and other intermediaries associated with the securities market;</li>

        <li>Registering and regulating the working of collective investment schemes including mutual funds;</li>

        <li>Promoting and regulating the self-regulatory organisation;</li>

        <li>Prohibiting fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities market;</li>

        <li>Promoting investors’ education and training of intermediaries of securities market;</li>

        <li>Prohibiting insider trading in securities;</li>

        <li>Regulating substantial acquisition of shares and takeover of companies; and</li>

        <li>Performing such functions and exercising such functions and exercising such powers under the provisions of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 and Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, as may be delegated to it by the Central Government.</li>
</ul>
      SEBI has been vested with wide-ranging powers. Firstly, to oversee the constitution as well as the operations of mutual funds including presentation of accounts, following the decision to allow the entry of private sector and joint sector mutual funds. Secondly, all stock exchanges in the country have been brought under the annual inspection regime of SEBI for ensuring orderly growth of stock markets and investors protection. Thirdly, with the repealing of the Capital Issue (Control) Act, 1947, in May 1992, SEBI has been made the regulatory authority in regard to new issues of companies. An amendment to the SEBI Act (1992) carried out of March 25, 1995 has empowered SEBI to register and regulate new intermediaries associated with the securities market are now regulated by SEBI.
<br><br>
<b>Participatory Notes (P-Notes):</b>

      Participatory notes, also referred to as “P-notes,” are financial instruments used by investors or hedge funds that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to invest in India securities. Any dividends or capital gains collected from the underlying securities go back to the investors. Indian regulators are against participatory notes because they fear that hedge funds acting through participatory notes will cause economic volatility in India’s exchanges.

     Budget is a statement of estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for the ensuing fiscal year (i.e. 1st April to 31st march). It is also known as ‘Annual Financial Statement’. As per Article 112 of the constitution, the President shall cause to be laid a financial statement before both the Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every financial year of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for that year. Article 202 of the constitution provides that a similar financial statement for each states will be placed before the legislature of the respective state.
<br>
     <b>The annual budget statement presents four kinds of estimates:</b>
<ul>
       <li> Actual estimates of the preceding year</li>

        <li>Budget estimates of the current year</li>

        <li>Revised estimates of the current year</li>

       <li> Budget estimates for the preceding years</li>
</ul>
<b>Surplus, Balanced and Deficit Budget</b>

     <b> Surplus budget:</b> If the receipts of the government are more than its expenditure the government will be said to have a surplus budget.

</div>
      Budget implies that government is misleading out more money from the economic system. It has a contractionary effect.
      <ol type="a">
                                         <li>Fall in the level of economic activity</li>

                                                    <li>Fall in investment</li>

                                                    <li>Fall in employment</li>

                                                          <li>Fall in income</li>

                                           <li>Fall in consumption and savings</li>
                                         </ol>

     <b> Balanced budget:</b> A balanced budget is one where the estimated revenue equals the estimated expenditure. If the receipts of the government equal its expenditure the government will said to have balanced budget. A balanced budget will have a neutral effect on the level of economic activity.<br>

      <b>Deficit budget:</b> It occurs when the overall expenditure of the government exceeds the overall receipts. Budgetary deficits is financed by printing of new currency notes by the government. If the receipts of the government are less than its expenditure the government will said to have a deficit budget.<br>

      <b>A deficit budget implies that the government is pumping in more money in the economic system than is pumping out. The process works as follows:</b><br>
          <ol type="a">
                                             <li>Expansion in economic activity</li>


                                             <li> Rise in investment</li>

                                                       <li>Rise in employment</li>

                                                           <li>Rise in income</li>

                                             <li>Rise in consumption and savings</li>
                                           </ol>

      This will move the economy further on the growth path. The Government in a developing economy always plans for a deficit budget.<br>

      <b>The budget shows the receipts and expenditure of the government (centre and states) under three heads:</b><br>
      <ul>

        <li><b>Consolidated fund:</b> It is the main account of the government and it consists of all the receipts of the government from taxes, loans and other receipts. No amount can be spent without prior sanction of the Parliament (or state legislature).</li>

        <li><b>Contingency fund:</b> It consists of the sum placed at the disposal of the President to meet unforeseen expenditure. The prior sanction of the Parliament or state legislature is not required under this fund but it is sought to replenish the fund.</li>

        <li><b>Public account:</b> It consists of all receipts and payments which are in the nature of a deposit account with the government such as small savings, provident funds, etc. No legislative sanction is required for withdrawal of money from this fund as it does not belong to the government and comes under the public account.</li>
</ul>
      <b>Union Finance Minister’s speech:</b> Finance Minister’s speech gives a broad overview of the Budget proposals. Generally it is in two parts. The first deals with a review of implementation of the preceding year’s schemes, revised estimates for the completed year and the budget estimates for the next year, without taking into account the impact of budget proposals. Part two of the speech deals with revenue mobilisation through tax proposals.<br><br>

      <b>Annual Financial statement:</b> Annual Financial Statement (AFS) is the main Budget document. Under Article 112 of the Constitution, a statement of estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India has to be laid before the Parliament in respect of every financial year from 1st April to 31st March. It shows the receipts and payments of government under three accounts-Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund and the Public Account.<br><br>

      <b>Demands for grants:</b> The estimates of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund, included in the Annual Financial Statement and required to be voted by the Lok Sabha, are submitted in the form of Demands for Grants in pursuance of Article 113 of the Constitution. Generally, one demand for Grant is presented in respect of each ministry or department.<br><br>

      <b>Budget at a glance:</b> The Budget at a glance gives an overview of the budgetary proposals. It gives a breakup of tax and other receipts as well as expenditures (plan and non-plan), allocations of outlays by ministries and resource transfers to states and UTs, the projections on revenue deficit and primary deficit, etc.<br><br>

      <b>Finance Bill:</b> The proposals of government for levy of new taxes, modification of the existing tax structure or continuance of the existing tax structure are submitted to the Parliament through the Finance Bill. To facilitate easy comprehension of the budget, certain explanatory documents are presented along with the budget.<br><br>

       <b>Appropriation Bill:</b> After the Lok Sabha on the Demands for Grants, Parliament’s approval to the withdrawal from the Consolidated fund of the amounts so voted and of the amount required to meet the expenditure ‘changed’ on the Consolidated Fund is sought through the Appropriation Bill.<br>

      The presentation of Budget is followed by a general discussion on it in both the Houses of parliament: Estimates of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India are placed before the Lok Sabha in the form of ‘Demand of Grants’. All withdrawals of money from the Consolidated Fund are therefore authorised by an Appropriation Act passed by the Parliament every year. Tax Proposals of the Budget are embodied in Bill which is passed as the ‘Finance Act’ of the year. Estimation of receipts and expenditure are similarly presented by the state governments in their legislature before the beginning of the financial year.<br>

<h6>Structure of the Budget</h6>
<ul>
  
      <li><b>Structure of the Budget refers to the components of the budget. It has two broad components:</b></li><br>

&rarr; Budget receipts, and<br>

&rarr;  Budget expenditure.<br>

        <li><b>Budget receipts refer to estimated money receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year. Broadly, the budget receipts are classified as:</b></li>

&rarr;  <b>Revenue receipts:</b> Such receipts accrue to the government on account of its current activities and are generally recurrent in nature. For example, tax receipts like income tax, excise tax etc. and non-tax revenue receipts like income from PSUs, interest received etc.<br>

&rarr;   <b>Capital receipts:</b> Such receipts either create liabilities (like borrowings) or reduce assets like disinvestment, recovery of loans, etc.<br>

        <li><b>Budget expenditure refers to the estimated expenditure of the government on its developmental and non-developmental programmes (or on its plan and non-plan programmes) during the fiscal year. Budget expenditure is also classified into two broad categories:</b></li>

&rarr;   Revenue expenditure: Such expenditure is incurred on day-to-day activities of the government and neither create assets nor reduce liabilities, e.g. interest payments, subsidies, etc.<br>

&rarr;  Capital expenditure: Such expenditure either creates asset or reduces liability of the government, e.g. expenditure on construction of road, bridge, building etc.<br>

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>BUDGETARY DEFLICITS</h3><hr>
<ul>
        <li><b>Budget deficit:</b> The budget deficit is the difference between the total expenditure and total receipts, other than internal capital receipts. It has to be financed through the sale of 91 days and hoc treasury bills to the RBI and drawing down of cash balances.

<b>Budget Deficit = Total Expenditure – Total Receipts = 91-day ad hoc treasury bills + cash withdrawals</b>

The issue of 91 days ad hoc treasury bills leads to the monetisation of the      deficit, (i.e. printing of new money), so government abandoned the practice of issuing such securities to the RBI since 1997. Instead, the government had initiated a scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA). Thus, the concept of budget deficit has become redundant.</li>

      <li> <b>Ways and Means Advances (WMA):</b> Under this Scheme, the RBI provides facilities for temporary accommodation of the financial needs of the government up to a ceiling. Now, yearly limits are divided into six months each, decided mutually between the government and the RBI at the beginning of a year. Thus, the WMA is purely a mechanism to bridge the temporary mismatch between the receipts and expenditure of the government.</li>

       <li><b>Revenue Deficit:</b> Revenue Deficit (RD) is the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts, i.e. R.D. Revenue expenditure – Revenue receipts (Revenue deficit shows the extent of reduction of assets or increment in liabilities of the government).</li>

<b>In simple terms, it can be understood as the excess of current consumption expenditure of the government (which does not yield any future benefit) over its current income. So, it is regarded as the worst kind of deficit from the perspective of economic welfare.</b>

<b>Effective Revenue deficit is a new term introduced in the Union Budget 2011-12. While revenue deficit is the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure, the present accounting system includes all grants from the Union Government to the state governments/Union territories/other bodies as revenue expenditure, even if they are used to create assets. Such assets created by the sub-national governments/bodies are owned by them and not by the Union Government. Nevertheless they do result in the creation of durable assets.</b>

       <li><b>Fiscal deficit:</b> Fiscal deficit is the excess of total expenditure of the government over the total receipts other than borrowings, i.e.,</li>

<b>F.D = Total Expenditure – Total receipts other than borrowings</b>

In other words, it can be defined as the difference between the total expenditure on one hand and the revenue receipts plus non-debt creating capital receipts on the other, i.e.,

<b>F. D = (Total Expenditure) – (Revenue Receipts + Non-debt creating capital receipts)</b>

Fiscal deficit shows the extent of increment in public debt, (i.e., total borrowings) during a fiscal year. It is the most comprehensive measure of deficit as it depicts the total resource gap of the government budget.

<b>Crowding out:</b> It refers to the reduction in private investment as a result of high interest rates due to excessive government borrowings.

       <li><b> Primary deficit:</b> Primary deficit (PD) is the difference between the fiscal deficit and interest payments, i.e.,</li>

<b>PD = Fiscal Deficit – Interest Payments.</b>

It reflects the status of the current operations of the government. That is, the extent to which current government policy is adding to future burdens stemming from past policy.

        <li><b>Monetised deficit:</b> It is also called Financing. It is defined as the net increase in RBI credit to the government during a fiscal year. Government borrowings from RBI directly add to high powered money i.e., printing of new money. It deficits the increase in the high powered money and leads to a multiple expansion in money supply, which generates inflation. Monetised Deficit is only a part of fiscal deficit as it takes into account borrowings of the government only from the RBI.</li>

<b>Public Expenditure</b>
<ul>
      Public expenditure refers to the total expenses incurred by the government on various heads. Public expenditure can be classified as revenue or capital development or non-developmental and plan or non-plan.

        <li><b>Plan expenditure and non-plan expenditure:</b> Plan expenditure refers to that expenditure whose provision is made under the annual budgets for those programmes and projects which are mentioned under the five-year plans. It includes expenditure on energy, social services, communication, transportation, agriculture, rural development, etc.</li>

       <li> Non-plan expenditure refers to that expenditure whose provision is made under the annual budgets on the items not included in the five-year plans. Simply, any expenditure other than plan expenditure is treated as non-plan expenditure. It includes expenditure on defence, interest payments, subsidies, expenditure on tax collection etc. (Note: Government Scrapped Distinction Between Plan & Non-Plan Expenditures in Budget 2016-17)</li>

        <li><b>Developmental and non-developmental expenditure:</b> Development expenditure relates to the growth and development activities of the government. This includes expenditure on education, health, industry, agriculture, transport, roads, etc.</li>

      Non-developmental expenditure is incurred on those items which do not directly promote growth and development economy. It includes expenditure on defence, interest payments, tax collections charges, civil administration, etc.<br>
      <br>
</ul>
<b>Public Debt</b>

      Public debt refers to the total accumulated borrowings of the government. Public debt includes internal debt comprising borrowings inside the country like market loans, compensation and other bonds, treasury bills, special securities issued to the RBI as well as non-negotiable non-interest bearing rupee securities issued to the international financial institutions. External debt comprises of loans from foreign countries and from international financial institutions like WB, IMF, ADB, etc.

      The other liabilities’ include outstanding against various small saving schemes, provident funds, securities issued to IDBI, UTI and nationalised bank, deposits schemes, reserve funds and deposits. While ‘public debt’                                     obligations are raise on the security of consolidated fund of India and are repayable out of it, ‘other liabilities’ are payable out of public Account Fund of India.

      A tax is a compulsory payment made by a person or a firm to the government without reference to any benefit, the payer may derive from the government.<br>

<b>Classification on the Basis of Method of Taxation</b>
<ul>
      <li><b> Progressive tax:</b> Under such taxation system, tax rate increases with the increase in income. It is based on the ‘ability to pay principle’ of taxation.

        <li><b>Proportional tax:</b> In the proportional tax system, tax rate remains constant irrespective of the level of income.</li>

        <li><b>Regressive tax:</b> In regressive taxation, tax rate decreases with increase in income. It is reverse of the progressive tax system. Such system of taxation is against the objective of a welfare state as it tends to accentuate income inequalities. So, it is only a theoretical concept, it has not been adopted by any country of the world.</li>

        <li><b>Degressive tax:</b> The degressive tax system is a mixture of proportional as well as progressive taxation system, so it is also called mild progressive tax. Under this system, tax rate increases with increase in income upto a limit than becomes constant.</li>

</ul> 

<b>Classification on the Basis of Imposition</b>
<ul>
       <li><b> Ad-valorem tax:</b> Under this tax system, tax is imposed on the basis of the value of the commodity. Such taxes are equitable in incidents as they conform with the ‘ability to pay principle’ of taxation.</li>

<b>101st Constitutional Amendment act & 122nd Constitutional Amendment Bill</b><br>

      GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market.

      GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer.

      GST is a destination based tax means that tax would accrue to the State or the Union Territory where the consumption takes places. It follows a multi-stage collection mechanism.

      In this, tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a set off at the next stage of transaction. This shifts the tax incidence near to the consumer and benefits the industry through better cash flows and better working capital management.
<br>
<b>GST Council</b><br>

      As per Article 279A (1) of the amended Constitution, the GST Council has to be Constituted by the President within 60 days of the commencement of Article 279A.<br>

       <b>GST Council shall consist of the following members namely:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Union Finance Minister-Chairperson</li>

        <li>The Union Minister of State, in-charge of Revenue of finance-Member</li>

        <li>The minister-in-charge of finance or taxation or any other Minister nominated by each State Government-Members</li>
</ul>

<b>Structure:</b>

      It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying tax on a common tax base.
    <ul>
        <li>Central tax (CGST)-levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods and services.</li>

        <li>State tax (SGST)/Union Territory tax (UTGST)- levied by the States including Union Territories without legislature.</li>
      </ul>
      An Integrated tax (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services. Accounts would be settled periodically between the Centre and the States to ensure that the SGST/UTGST portion of IGST is transferred to the destination State where the goods or services are eventually consumed.
      <br>
      <br>

<b>GST would apply to all the goods except.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcoholic liquor for human consumption.</li>

        <li>Five petroleum products, viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel.</li>
      </ul>
<b>It would apply to all services barring a few to be specified.</b>

      GST would replace the following taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre:
      <ul>
        <li>Central Excise Duty</li>

       <li> Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products)</li>

        <li>Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD)</li>

        <li>Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD)</li>

        <li>Service TAX</li>

       <li>Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services</li>
     </ul>
<b>State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST are:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>State VAT</li>

        <li>Central Sales Tax</li>

        <li>Luxury Tax</li>

        <li>Entry Tax (all forms)</li>

        <li>Entertainment and Amusement Tax (except when levied by the local bodies)</li>

        <li>Taxes on advertisements</li>

        <li>Purchase Tax</li>

        <li>axes on lotteries, betting and gambling</li>

        <li>State Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services</li>
      </ul>
<b>GSTN:</b>

      A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, taxpayers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST.<br>

      <b>The functions of the GSTN would, include:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Facilitating registration;</li>

        <li>Forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities;</li>

        <li>Computation and settlement of IGST;</li>

        <li>Matching of tax payment details with banking network;</li>

        <li>Providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the taxpayer return information;</li>

        <li>Providing analysis of taxpayers’ profile;</li>

        <li>Running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit.</li>
      </ul>
<b>Minimum Alternative Tax:</b>

      The Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) is the minimum amount of tax that a profitable company has to pay even if it is not liable to pay any tax as per the normal tax communication. There were instances when the earnings of some of the biggest Indian companies was more than the gross revenues of some states but these companies paid no taxes by taking advantage of various tax incentives. The government noting this anomaly; introduced MAT in 1983.<br>

      Very few countries apart from India have levied the Minimum Alternative. Tax USA is one. In USA, it is known as the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
<br><br>
<b>Laffer Curve:</b>

      It depicts the relation between the tax rate and tax revenue. It shows that as the tax rate increases, tax revenue also increase, but after optimum level, tax revenue declines with increase in the tax rate.<br><br>

<b>Mechanism of Resource Transfer:</b>

      The basic principle of federal finance is that all the constituent units should have adequate sources of revenue. It has further been realised that the States, left to themselves, cannot raise sufficient revenues to ,meet their functional needs. Moreover, wide inter-State disparities exists. An important objective of development effort is to remove these regional disparities. A consideration of these different factors points to the need for a balancing factor. Such a balancing factor is provided by the principle of transfer. Our financial system has provided for the transfer of resources from the Centre to the States. The important means of resource transfer are as follows:
        <ul>
       <li> Proceeds of some taxes assigned to the State: As described, above proceeds of some taxes that are levied and collected by the Centre are transferred to the States.</li>

        <li><b>Tax-sharing:</b> Similarly, proceeds of taxes that are levied and collected by the Centre are shared with the States, e.g. income tax and Union excise duties.</li>

        <li><b>Grants-in-Aids:</b> Provisions exist in our financial system for grants-in-aid of revenue from the Centre to the State. Grants may be broadly classified as ‘plan’ and ‘non-plan’ grants. The ‘plan grants’ are made on the recommendations of the Planning Commission whereas the ‘non-plan grants’ are made on the recommendations of the Financial Commission.</li>

        <li><b>Loan:</b> The Central is authorised to give loans to the State Governments subject to such conditions as may be laid down by or under any law made by Parliament. The loans are charged to the Consolidated Fund of India.</li>

        <li><b>Other source of transfer:</b> In addition to transfer of resources from the Centre to the States according to the recommendations of the Finance Commission, there are two other sources of transfer:</li>

  &rarr; Assistance of plan purpose from the Planning Commission, and<br>

  &rarr; iscretionary grants from the Centre to the States.

     The FRBM Act, 2003 (as amended), which became effective from July 5, 2004 mandates the Central Government to eliminate revenue deficit by March 2009 and to reduce fiscal deficit to an amount equivalent to 3% of GDP by  March 2008.the annual targets for fiscal correction were to be specified by rules to be farmed under the FRBM Act on July 5, 2004.<br>

<b>Task Force on Implementation of FRBM Act</b><br>

      Following the enactment of FRBM Act, Government constituted a Task force headed by Dr. Vijay Kelkar for drawing up the medium-term framework for fiscal policies to achieve the FRBM targets. The Task Force was also asked to formulate annual targets indicating the path of adjustment and required policy measures. The Task Force submitted its report in July 2004. The Task Force recommended a path of fiscal adjustment that this front loaded and mainly revenue-led, with complementary reform efforts on revenue expenditure and enhanced capital expenditure to counteract the possible contractionary effects of fiscal correction.<br>

      The Task Force estimated that under the reforms scenario recommended by it, tax-GDP ratio of the Centre would improve from 9.2% in 2003-04 (RE) to 13.2% in 2008-09. Total expenditure is estimated to come down 14.3% of GDP by 2008-09 from 15.4% of GDP in 2003-04 (RE). A revenue surplus of 0.2% of GDP is estimated in 2008=-09. Fiscal deficit is estimated to come down from 4.8% of GDP in 2003-04 to 2.8% of GDP in 2008-09.

      The Balance of Payments (BoP record the transactions in goods, services and assets between residents of a country with the rest of the world. There are two main accounts in the BoP- the current account and the capital account. The current account records exports and imports in goods and services and transfer payments. Trade in services denoted as invisible trade (because they are not seen to cross national borders) includes both factor income ( payment for inputs investment income, that is, the interest, profits and dividends on our assets abroad minus the income foreigners earn on assets they own in India) and non-factor income (shipping, banking, insurance, tourism, software services, etc.).
      <br>
      Transfer payments are receipts which the residents of a country receive ‘for free’, without having to make any present or future payments in return. They consist of remittances, gifts and grants. They could be official or private. The balance of exports and imports of goods is referred to as the trade balance.<br>

      Adding trade in services and net transfers to the trade balance, we get the current account balance. The capital account records all international purchases and sales of assets such as money, stocks, bonds, etc. we note that any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered as a debit and is given a negative sign. Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered as a credit and is given a positive sign.<br>

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h3>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</h3><hr>

      Foreign investment is the equity capital which comes in two forms. Investments made in financial assets is called Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI). The investment made in physical assets by foreign individuals and firms is called Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
<ul>
       <li><b> Direct foreign investment:</b> Foreign capital can enter India in the form of direct investment. Sometimes companies of advanced countries start their subsidiary offices and affiliates in India. Alternately foreigners may subscribe to stocks and debentures of concerns in India. This is known as portfolio or entire investment.</li>

       <li><b> Foreign collaboration:</b> There are three types of foreign collaborations-joint participation between private parties, between foreign firms and Indian Government and between foreign governments and Indian Government.</li>

        <li><b>Inter-government loans:</b> Since 1946, the World Bank and its affiliates have been important suppliers of capital to India. International Monetary Fund (IMF), Aid India Consortium, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have been the major sources of external assistance to India recent years.</li>

        <li><b>External Commercial Borrowing ( ECB):</b> India has also been tapping export credit agencies like the US Exim Bank, the Japanese Exim Bank, ECGC of the UK, etc., to obtain a major portion of the commercial borrowing from the capital market.</li>
</ul>
<b>Foreign Portfolio Investment</b><br>

      It refers to the purchase of assets abroad but without any control over them. It involves investment in bonds, shares, securities or deposits with banks abroad. FPI is mainly a financial investment and can move out of a country at a short notice. The sources of portfolio investment are as follows:
<ul>
        <li><b>Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs):</b> These are investment institutions like mutual funds, venture capital funds, merchant banks, insurance funds etc., which invest in foreign securities markets.</li>

        <li><b>Euro issues:</b> It refers to the issue of securities to raise funds from a foreign financial markets.</li>

        <li><b>Global Depository Receipts (GDRs):</b> GDRs are dollar denominated securities issued by a foreign financial intermediary called Overseas Depository Bank (ODB) in lieu of the underlying domestic securities. Such securities (GDRs) can be freely traded in the foreign capital markets.</li>

        <li><b>American Depository receipts (ADRs):</b> The Global Depository receipts (GDRs) issued in USA are called ADRs.</li>

        <li><b>Participatory Notes (PN):</b> These are offshore derivative instruments issued by a Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) against underlying domestic securities.</li>

      After a subdued performance in 2002-03, portfolio flows rebound strongly in US$ 11.4 billion in 2003-04. The impressive performance of portfolio investment in 2003-04 was on account of a rapid influx of FII inflows, driven by the heavy bullish sentiments prevailing in the Indian stock markets.<br>
</ul>
<b>Foreign Direct Investment</b><br>

      Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to the purchase of assets abroad along with the power to control them. It is the most preferred form of capital inflows as it is non-debt and long-term in nature. FDI can be made by a Multinational Corporation (MNC) or by its subsidiary or by way of joint enterprise involving a MNC and a domestic partner.

      The benefits from FDI do not accrue automatically and evenly across countries and sectors. In order to reap the maximum benefits from FDI, there is a need to establish a transparent, broad and effective enabling policy environment for investment and to put in place appropriate framework for their implementation. Such an environment must provide incentives for innovations and improvement of skills and contribute towards improved competitiveness.

      Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was passed by the Parliament in 1999 and it came into effect on June 1, 2000. It seeks to repeal Foreign exchange Regulation act (FERA), 1973 but FERA was provided a sunset clause of two years to enable the Enforcement Directorate to dispose off the pending cases.
      <br>

<b>Salient features</b><br>
<ul>

        <li>Only authorised person can deal in transfer forex or security.</li>

       <li> No person residing in India shall acquire, hold forex, property etc., outside India except as provided in this act.</li>

        <li>Violation of FEMA would be treated as civil offence, unlike in case of FERA violation which involves criminal proceedings and arrest.</li>

        <li>Enforcement Directorate could not arrest but can search, seize forex, summon, adjudicate and impose penalty upto thrice the sum involved in such contravention.</li>
</ul>
<b>Export Finance</b><br>

      Pre-shipment and post-shipment credits are the customary banking credit facilities for exports. Traditional exports (such as tea), with foreign exchange from such exports realised typically within 180 days from shipment, require finance which is short-term in nature. Non-traditional exports, covering products such as capital goods, services and project exports, however, require deferred credit over the medium (1-5 years) and long-term (beyond 5 years and up to 10 years). Commercial banks, with their liability structure short-term in character, concentrate on traditional, short-term export finance. Export credit of schedule commercial banks amounted to 65,914 crore at end-March 2005. Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank), with its medium/long-term liability structure, concentrates primarily on medium to long-term export finance, besides working capital. Exim Bank also provides refinance and rediscounting facilities to commercial banks so that short-term exports are not affected by lack of finance. Exim Bank’s lending has steadily increased over the years. In 2005-06, Exim Bank’s approved loans increased by over 29% to 20,489 crore.<br>

      Exim Bank’s provides finance at various stages of the export cycle-import finance, product, development, production, marketing, pre-shipment and post-shipment-as well as for overseas investment. It has a range of export credit programmes, such as supplier’s and buyer’s credit, for Indian companies executing contracts overseas for projects, products, as well as services. The Exim Bank also extends guarantee facilities to facilitate Indian companies in executing export contracts and extends lines of credit, on its owner at the behest of the Government of India, to overseas government, or to agencies nominated by them, or to financial institutions overseas for encouraging imports from India on deferred payment term. Exim Bank’s import lines of credit provide financing for imports of capital goods and related services particularly for enhancing export production capabilities of small and medium-sised export-oriented units.<br>

<b>Types of Foreign Trade Policy</b><br>

      <b>Free trade versus Protection:</b> Free trade policy refers to the trade policy that is free from all artificial barriers of trade like tariffs, quantitative restrictions and other devices obstructing the movement of goods between countries. Protection the other hand, refers to government policy of providing protection to the domestic industries from foreign competition. The domestic industries are protected by imposing import duties which raise the price of foreign goods and by imposing various trade barriers.<br>

     Outward oriented strategy versus Inward oriented strategy: Under outward-oriented strategy, trade and industrial policies do not discriminate between production for the domestic goods and foreign goods. Government imposes least restrictions on trade and foreign investment. While under the inward-oriented strategy, government accords high levels of protection for domestic industries through trade barriers and direct controls on imports and foreign investment.<br>

<b>Trade barriers</b><br>
<ul>
      Trade barriers refer to the government measures which obstructs the free flow of goods and services across national borders. Trade barriers can be classified under two groups i.e., tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers.<br>

        <li><b>Tariff barriers:</b>Tariff refer to the taxes imposed on internationally traded commodities when they cross national i.e., customs duties like import and export taxes.</li>
</ul>
<b>Non-tariff barriers (NTBs):</b> NTBs refers to the restrictions on trade other than custom duties. NTBs include Quantitative Restrictions (QRs), Import Licencing, cannalisation, foreign exchange controls, etc. QRs refer to the fixation of ceiling on the quantity or value of a commodity which can be imported or exported during a specific period.

      Globalisation refers to the integration of an economy with the world economy. An economy can be globalised by pursuing the free trade policy or the outward-oriented strategy. An economy may be integrated with other economies by removing restriction on the movement of goods and services, capital, technology and persons among the different countries. A globalised economy becomes a part of the global economy or global market. It is characterised by the free flow of products and factors, uniform laws and rules, free exchanges and full convertibility of currencies. The prices of products, rewards of factors, exchange rates of currencies etc. are determined by market forces and are same across the countries.
<br>
<br>
<b>Advantages of Globalisation.</b>
<ul>
        <li>Globalisation leads to most economic utilisation of resources of the world because resources are allocated on the basis of ‘comparative advantages’, i.e., each country will produce those goods for which it is best suited.</li>

        <li>It promotes specialisation and division of labour on an international scale leading to greater efficiency and economy in production.</li>

        <li>It promotes competition and suppresses domestic monopolies.</li>

        <li>It enables the consumers to obtain a wide variety of goods from the cheapest source.</li>

       Foreign exchange rate refers to the rate at which one unit of a currency of a country can be exchanged for the number of unit of another currency. It is the price of a currency in terms of another currency.<br>

       <b>Foreign exchange market:</b> The foreign exchange market is the market where the national currencies are traded for one another. There are two segments of the foreign exchange market, i.e., spot market and forward market.<br>

<b>Types of Exchange Rate Systems</b>
<br><ul>
        <li><b>Fixed exchange rate system:</b> Under system, exchange rate is officially declared by the monetary authority (Central Bank) and it is fixed. There are two variants of system:</li>

  &rarr;<b>Gold Standard System:</b> Under gold standard (or mint par value) system, the exchange rate of each currency is fixed in terms of gold.<br>

  &rarr; <b>Adjustable peg system:</b> Under adjustable peg (or Briton Woods) system, the exchange rate of each country was fixed in terms of US dollar, which was made convertible into gold at a fixed price. Adjustment in the parity value of a currency was allowed by the IMF under certain circumstances.

        <li><b>Wider bands:</b> Under wider bands system, wider adjustment in the fixed exchange rate is allowed. It allows adjustments upto 10% around the parity value between any two currencies.</li>

        <li><b>Crawling peg:</b> This system allows small but regular adjustment in the exchange rate bands for different currencies.</li>

        <li><b>Managed float:</b> Under this system, the exchange rate is market determined but the central bank possesses authority to intervene in the exchange rate determination by influencing the demand and supply of currencies. There are officially declared rules and guidelines for the intervention by the monetary authority. Managed floating with the absence of rules and regulations could be vulnerable to abuse of intervention. A particular country could manipulate the exchange rate of its currency to the detriment of other countries. This behaviour is called as ‘Dirty Float’.</li>

        <li><b>Flexible or floating exchange rate system:</b> Under this system, the exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply of the currencies concerned in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate is freely determined by the market forces without any government intervention.</li>

 
</ul>
 

<b>India’s Exchange rate Policy</b>
<br>
      The Indian rupee was historically linked to the British pound sterling till 1946. Soon after Second World War, the IMF was set up and as the founder member of IMF, India had to fix and maintain the external value of the rupee in terms of gold or the (U.S. Dollar). The IMF system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in early 1970s. In 1975, the Government of India delinked the rupee from pound sterling and directed RBI to determine the rate of exchange of the rupee with respect to the exchange rate movements of the basket of currencies, viz. the Pound, U.S. Dollar, Yen and Deutsche Mark.
<br>
<b>Objectives of Exchange Rate Policy</b>
<ul>

       <b>Following are the important objective of exchange rate policy and management:</b>

       <li>To ensure that economic fundamentals are reflected in the external value of the rupee.</li>

        <li>To reduce excess volatility in exchange rates.</li>

        <li>To help maintain an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves.</li>

        <li>To prevent the emergence of destabilising speculative activities.</li>

        <li>To develop an orderly foreign exchange market.</li>

<b>Exchange Rate System in India</b><br>

      Presently, there is ‘managed float’ system of exchange rate in India. The exchange rate is broadly market determined with selective intervention by the RBI. The focus of the exchange rate management policy is to smoothen the fluctuation in the exchange rate with no specific rate target.
<br>
<b>Effective Exchange rate</b>
<br>
      The effective exchange rate measures the strength of the domestic currency in relation to the currencies of its major trading partners. According to Salvador, <b style="color: red;s">“Effective Exchange rate is a weighted average of the exchange rates between the currency of a country and its most important trading partners”</b>.<br>

      In India, the effective exchange rates are complied in relation of five and ten major trading partners. (i.e., 5-country index and 10-country index). The effective exchange rates of two types are as follows:

       <li><b>Nominal Effective Exchange rate (NEER):</b> It is the weighted average of exchange rates of a current vis-a-vis the currencies of major trading partners. It is not adjusted for the changes in the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Real Effective Exchange Rate (REFR):</b> It is that type of effective exchange rate which is adjusted for the relative changes in the price level across the concerned countries. It is based on constant prices or real exchange rates.</li>

       <b>Hard currency:</b> A currency that is in strong demand and its value is expected to remain stable due to strong performance of its economy, e.g. US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro etc.<br>

       <b>Soft currency:</b> A currency that has a limited demand in the foreign exchange market and its value is prone to fluctuations, e.g. India rupee, Nepalese rupee, Libyan dinar, etc.<br>

      <b>Hot money:</b> It refers to the short-term funds held by banks and portfolio investments which quickly move out or into a country in anticipation of better earnings or in apprehension of adverse circumstances.<br><br>

<b>Terms associated with international trade</b>
<ul>

        <li><b>Dumping:</b> It refers to selling of a commodity in foreign market at a price, which is lower than either the price prevailing in the domestic market or the cost of production. The objectives of dumping may be to suppress competition in the international market, to dispose of temporary surplus or to advantage of large-scale production.</li>

        <li><b>Anti-dumping duties:</b> These are the additional customers duties levied by the comporting country to offset the low prices of imported goods due to dumping.</li>

        <li><b>Countervailing duty:</b> A tax levied on an imported product, which raise its price in the domestic market, as a means of counteracting unfair trading practices by other countries.<br>

Such duties are generally employed against imported products which are deliberately subsidised by the foreign government to promote their exports.</li>

                    <div class="card-body" style="text-align: justify;"><h2> POVERTY IN INDIA</h2><hr>

<b>THE CONCEPT OF POVERTY</b><br><br>

       To understand the problem of poverty better, we must distinguish between absolute poverty and relative poverty.<br><br>

       Absolute Poverty of a person means that his income or consumption expenditure is so meagre that he lives below the minimum subsidence level. Because of his absolute poverty condition, he is not able to maintain his health and efficiency and in fact he may be starving.<br><br>

       On the other hand, Relative Poverty merely indicates the large inequalities of income. Those who are in the lower income brackets receive less than those in the higher income groups. The people with lower incomes are relatively poor compared to those with higher incomes, even though they may be living above the minimum level of subsistence. It is absolute poverty with which we are concerned when we talk of the problem of poverty in India. Affluent countries such as the USA have succeeded in removing absolute poverty from their people, but relative poverty, even prevails in them because of uneven distribution of income.<br><br>

       The Planning Commission adopted an alternative definition of poverty provided by the <b style="color: red;">“Task force on projections of minimum needs and effective consumption demand”</b>. Using the income poverty method, the Task Force has defined the poverty line as the midpoint of the monthly per capita expenditure class having a daily calorie intake of 2,400 per person in rural areas and 2,100 in urban areas.<br><br>

       <b>THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATERGIES:</b>
       <br><br>
<ul>
        <li>Seek to attain the most rapid growth possible and sustain it over a decade so as to increase incomes and the demand for labour. The Tenth Plan target GDP growth rate is 8%.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the pattern of output is as labour-intensive and capital-savings as possible without distorting the normal comparative advantage of products. This will maximise the demand for labour and avoid rising unemployment.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the best attainable growth rates are achieved by the States and areas with the largest concentrations of the poor. This will be helped by implementation of the good governance actions, summarised above.</li>

        <li>Provide additional Central resources for States which undertake effective reform programmes.</li>

        <li>Continue to give top priority to primary education enrolment and attendance, especially of girls.</li>

        <li>Similarly, emphasise primary healthcare and adequate nutrition, especially of children and women.</li>

        <li>Implement area-based programmes where the problems of poverty are greatest or most intractable, and</li>

        <li>Target vulnerable minorities which might not be able to benefit from other programmes.</li>

<b>Alagh Committee 91979):</b> In 1979, a task force constituted by the Planning Commission for the purpose of poverty estimation, chaired by Y.K Alagh, constructed a poverty line for rural and urban areas on the basis of nutritional requirements. Poverty estimates for subsequent years were to be calculated by adjusting the price level for inflation.<br>


      <b>Lakdawala Committee (1993):</b> In 1993, an expert group constituted to review methodology for poverty estimation, chaired by D.T. Lakdawala, made the following suggestions:
<ul>
      <li>Consumption and expenditure should be calculated based on calorie consumption as earlier;</li>

        <li>State specific poverty lines should be constructed and these should be updated using the Consumer Price Index of Industrial workers (CPI-IW) in urban areas and Consumer Price Index of agricultural labour(CPI-AL) in rural areas; and</li>

        <li>Discontinuation of <b style="color: red;">‘scaling’</b> of poverty estimates based on National Accounts Statistics. The assumes that the basket of goods and services used to calculate CPI-IW and CPI-AL reflect the consumption patterns of the poor.</li>
<br>

      <li><b>Tendulkar Comittee (2009):</b> In 2005, another expert group to review methodology for poverty estimation, chaired by Suresh Tendulkar was constituted by the Planning Commission to address the following three shortcomings of the previous methods:</li>

        <li>Consumption patterns were linked to the 1973-74Poverty Line Baskets (PLBs) of goods and services, whereas there were significant changes in the consumption patterns of the poor since that time, which were not reflected in the poverty estimates;</li>

        <li>There were issues with the adjustment of prices for inflation, both spatially (across regions) and temporally (across time); and</li>

        <li>Earlier poverty lines assumed that health and education would be provided by the State and formulated poverty lines accordingly.</li>

        <li><b>It recommended four major changes:</b></li>
          <ol type="a">
        <li>A shift away from calorie consumption based poverty estimation;</li>

        <li>A uniform Poverty Line Basket (PLB) across rural and urban India;</li>

        <li>A change in the price adjustment procedure to correct spatial and temporal issues with price adjustment; and</li>

        <li>Incorporation of private expenditure on health and education while estimating poverty.</li>
</ol>
        <li>The Committee recommended using Mixed Reference Period (MRP) based estimates, as opposed to Uniform Reference Period (URP) based estimates that were used in earlier methods for estimating poverty.</li>

       It based its calculations on the consumption of the following items: cereals, pulses, milk, edible oil, non-vegetarian items, vegetables, fresh fruits, dry fruits, sugar, salt & Spices, other foods, intoxicants, fuel, clothing, footwear, education, medical (non-institutional and institutional), entertainment, personal & toilet goods, other goods, other services and durables.<br><br>

      The Committee computed new poverty lines for rural and urban areas of each state. To do this, it used data on value and quantity consumed of the items mentioned above by the population that was classified as poor by the previous urban poverty line. It concluded that the all India poverty line was 44.68 per capita per month in rural areas and 578.80 per capita per month in urban areas in 2004-05. The following table outlines the manner in which the percentage of population below the poverty line changed after the application of the Tendulkar Committee’s methodology.<br><br>

<br>
       The Committee also recommended a new method of updating poverty lines, adjusting for changes in prices and patterns of consumption, using the consumption basket of people close to the poverty line. Thus, the estimates released in 2009-10 and 2011-12 use this method instead of using indices derived from the CPI-AL for rural areas and CPI-IW for urban areas as was done earlier. Table above outlines the poverty lines computed using the Tendulkar Committee methodology for the years 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12.
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Rangarajan Committee:</b> In 2012, the Planning Commission constituted a new expert panel on poverty estimation, chaired by C. Rangarajan with the following key objectives:</li>

       <li>To provide an alternate method to estimate poverty levels and examine whether poverty lines should be fixed solely in terms of a consumption basket or if other criteria are also relevant;</li>

        <li>To examine divergence between the consumption estimates based on the NSSO methodology and those emerging from the National Accounts aggregates;</li>

        <li>To review international poverty estimation methods and indicate whether based on these, a particular method for empirical poverty estimation can be developed in India, and</li>

        <li>To recommend how these estimates of poverty can be linked to eligibility and entitlements under the various schemes of the Government of India.</li>

<ul>
       <li>Structural unemployment is a longer-lasting for of unemployment caused by fundamental shifts in an economy and exacerbated by extraneous factors such as technology, competition and government policy. Reasons why structural unemployment occurs include workers lack of requisite job skills or that workers live too far from regions where jobs are available and cannot move closer. Jobs are available, but there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer.</li>

        <li>Cyclical unemployment is a factor of overall unemployment that relates to the cyclical trends in growth and production that occur within the business cycle. When business cycles are at their peak, cyclical unemployment will be low because total economic output is being maximised. When economic output falls, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the business cycle is low and cyclical unemployment will rise.</li>

        <li>Disguised unemployment exists where part of the labour force is either left without work or is working in a redundant manner where worker productivity is essentially zero. It is unemployment that does not affect aggregate output. An economy demonstrates disguised unemployment when productivity is low and too many workers are filling too few jobs.</li>

        <li>Seasonal unemployment occurs when there is limited need for a specific type of work to be performed during a certain time of the year. Professionals who work in a specific season often charge fees for their services, which provide the equivalent of an annual income, or work in multiple fields with different prime seasons. Industries where seasonal unemployment is common include farming, tourism and construction.</li>

      <b>SECC-2011</b>
      <p>The Ministry of Rural Development Government of India, commenced the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011, in June 2011 through a comprehensive door to door enumeration across the country. This is the first time such a comprehensive exercise has been carried out for both rural and urban India. It is also expected to generate information on a large number of social and economic indicators relating to households across the country.</p>

      

<b>The SECC, 2011 has the following three objectives:</b>
<ul>

        <li>To enable households to be ranked based on their Socio-Economic status. State Governments can then prepare a list of families living below the poverty line.</li>

        <li>To make available authentic information that will enable caste-wise population enumeration of the country.</li>

        <li>To make available authentic information regarding the socio-economic condition, and education status of various castes and sections of the population.</li>
</ul>

        <p>The Ministry of Rural Development has taken a decision to use the SECC data in all its programmes. SECC data would have meaningful use in Housing for all, Education and Skills thrust, MGNREGA, National Food Security Act, interventions for differently able, interventions for women led households, and targeting of households/individual entitlements on evidence of deprivation, etc. the household data is also available for planners of programmes at State, District, Block, Gram Panchayat and village level. SEC provides an opportunity to simultaneously address the multi-dimensionality of poverty by addressing the deprivation of households in education, skills, housing, the deprivation of households in education, skills, housing, employment, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, social and gender mobilisation and entitlement. The use of the NPR TIN Number across programmes afford an opportunity to track the progress of households over the years. SECC truly makes evidence based targeted household interventions for poverty reduction possible. It paves the way for a Mission Antyodaya to work simultaneously in addressing the poverty of households through a Gram Panchayat Poverty Reduction Plan. The Ministry of Rural Development, in consultation with States, is trying to implement a convergent, integrated poverty reduction plan with Gram Panchayats and deprived  households as priority.</p>
