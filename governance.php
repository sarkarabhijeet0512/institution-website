	<h6>COMETITION ACT, 2002</h6>
		In the era of LPG, it was felt that the existing Monopolies and Restrictive Trade practices Act, 1969 has become obsolete in certain respects and there is a need to shift our focus from curbing monopolies to promoting competition act has been enacted. The main objectives of the act are provide for the establishment of a commission to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain competition in markets in India, to protect the interests of consumers and to ensure freedom of trade carried on by participants in market India and for related matters. The Act mainly covers the following aspects:
		<ul>
	<li>Prohibition of anti-competitive agreements;</li>
	<li>Prohibition of abuse of dominance;</li>
	<li>Regulation of combination (acquisitions, mergers and amalgamations of certain size);</li>
	<li>Establishment of Competition Commission of India (CCI);</li>
	<li>Functions and powers of CCI.</li>
	<li>The Act identifies three such ways in which such practices could occur, as under:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Anti –competitive agreements (Horizontal Agreements, Vertical Agreements).</li>
	<li>Abuse of dominant Position.</li>
Elimination/reduction of competitors in market achieved through acquisitions, amalgamations or mergers.
</ol>
<h6>MAKE IN INDIA</h6>

<ul>
	<li>With the objective of making India a global hub of manufacturing, design and innovation, the Make in India initiative, which is based on four pillars :- new process, new infrastructure, new sectors and new mindset, has been taken by the Government. The initiative is set to boost entrepreneurship,  not only in manufacturing but in relevant infrastructure and service sectors as well. An interactive portal http://makeinindia.com for dissemination of information and interaction with investors has been created with the objective of generating awareness about the investment opportunities and prospects of the country to promote India as a preferred Investment opportunities and prospects of the country, to promote India as preferred investment destination in markets overseas and to increase Indian share of global FDI. In addition, information on 25 thrust sectors, along with details of the FDI Policy, National Manufacturing Policy, Intellectual Property Rights and the proposed National Industrial Corridors including the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor(DMIC), are available on the portal.</li>
	<li>The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion(DIPP), in consultation with various central ministries, state Governments, industry leaders, and other stakeholders, has formulated a strategy for increasing the contribution of the manufacturing sector to 25 percent of the GDP by 2020.</li>
	<li>The Government of India has set up Invest India as the national investment promotion and facilitation agency. With the objective of promoting investment in the country, a full-fledged Investment Facilitation Cell has been set-up under the Make in India initiative, primarily  to support all investment queries as well as to handhold and liaise with various agencies on behalf of potential investors.</li>
	<li>As envisages by the National Manufacturing Policy 2011 , Make in India seeks to create 100 million additional jobs in Manufacturing by 2022. The Government is taking a number of steps to enhance the skills of workers/ the unemployed in India in order to improve their employability. In order to tap the creative potential and boost entrepreneurship in India, the Start-up India, Stand-up India campaign has been announced. An Innovation promotion platform called Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and a techno-financial, incubation and facilitation programme called Self-Employment and Talent Utilization (SETU) are being implemented to encourage innovation and start-ups in India.</li>
	<li>For supporting the financial needs of the small and medium enterprises sector and promote start-ups and entrepreneurship, the government has taken various steps through Make in India. The India aspiration Fund has also been set-up under the small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) for venture capital financing of newly set-up or expanding units in the MSME sector . SIDBI Make in India Loan for Small Enterprises (SMILE) has been launched to offer quasi-equity and term-based short-term loans to Indian SMEs with less stringent rules and regulations and special focus on 25 thrust sectors of Make in India. Further, a Micro Units Development Refinance agency (MUDRA) Bank has been set-up to provide development and refinance to commercial banks/ NBFCs/ cooperative banks for loans given to micro-units. MUDRA Bank would follow a credit-plus approach by also providing financial literacy and addressing skill gaps, information gaps, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Recent Initiatives:</h6>
	eBiz Portal – India’s Government –to-Business (G2B) portal was conceptualized with support from National Institute of Smart  Government(NISG) as the consulting partner and developed by M/s. Infosys ltd., Bangalore in a Public Private Partnership(PPP)Model for a period of 10 years. The first three years of the term would be the pilot phase, while the remaining seven years will be the expansion phase.
	The Comptroller General of Accounts has given approval to establish the electronic system of collection, apportionment and remittance of fees collected under the eBiz portal. It is for the first time in the country that collection of fees through credit and debit cards for different services have been permitted making it very convenient for business to deposit fees.
	Niryat Bandhu Scheme: DGFT (Director General of Foreign Trade) introduced a new “Niryat Bandhu” scheme for International Business mentoring for young Turks in international business enterprises. The office (Niryat Bandhu) would function in the mentoring field and would be a handholding experiment for the young turks in international business enterprises. Under  the scheme, officers of DGFT will be investing time and knowledge to mentor the interested individuals who want to conduct the business in a legal way.


	<h6>SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES</h6>
	In Indian economy, small-scale and cottage industries occupy an important place, because of their employment potential and their contribution to total industrial output and exports. Government of India has taken a number of steps to promote them. However, with the recent measures, small-scale and cottage industries facing both internal competition as well as external competition. There is no clear distinction between small-scale and cottage industries. However it is generally believed that cottage industry is one which is carried on wholly or primarily with the help of the members of the family. As against this, small-scale industry employs hired labour.
<h6>Defination</h6>
<ol type="A">

<b>The official definitions of a small scale unit are as follows:</b>
	<li><b>Small-scale industries:</b> These are the industrial undertakings having fixed investment in plant and machinery, whether held on ownership basis or lease basis or hire purchase basis not exceeding Rs. 1 crore.</li>
	<li><b>Ancillary Industries:</b> These are industrial undertakings having fixed investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs. 1 crore engaged in or proposed to engage in, a. The manufacture of parts, components, sub-assemblies, tooling or intermediaries, or b. The rendering of services supplying 30 percent of their production or services as the case may be, to other units for production of other articles.</li>
	<li><b>Tiny Units:</b> These refer to undertakings having fixed investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs. 23 lakhs. These also include undertakings providing services such as laundry, Xeroxing , repairs and maintenance of customer equipment and machinery, hatching and poultry etc. Located in towns with population less than 50,000.</li>
	<li><b>Small-Scale Service establishments:</b> These mean enterprises engaged in personal or household service in rural areas and town with population not exceeding 50000 and having fixed investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs. 25 lakhs.</li>
	<li><b>Household Industries:</b> These cover artisans skilled craftsman and technicians who can work in their own houses if their work requires less than 300 square feet space, less than 1Kw power, less than 5 workers and no pollution is caused. Handicrafts, toys, dolls, small plastic and paper products electronic and electrical gadgets are some examples of these industries.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Characteristics of Small-Scale Industries:</h6>
<ol type="A"> 
	<li><b>Ownership:</b> Ownership of small-scale unit is with one individual in sole-proprietorship or it can be with a few individuals in partnership.</li>
	<li><b>Management and Control:</b> A small-scale unit is normally a one-man show and even in case of partnership the activities are mainly carried out by the active partner and the rest are generally sleeping partners. These units are managed in a personalized fashion. The owner is activity involved in all the decisions concerning business.</li>
	<li><b>Area of operation:</b> The area of operation of small units is generally localized catering to the local or regional demand. The overall resources at the disposal of small-scale units are limited and as a result of this, it is forced to confine its activities to the local level.</li>
	<li><b>Technology:</b> Small industries are fairly labour intensive with comparatively smaller capital investment than the larger units. Therefore, these units are more suited for economics where capital is scare and there is abundant supply of labour.</li>
	<li><b>Gestation Period:</b> Gestation period is that period after which teething problems are over and return on investment starts. Gestation period of small-scale unit is less as compared to large-scale unit.</li>
	<li><b>Flexibility:</b> Small-scale units as compared to large-scale units are more change susceptible and highly reactive and responsive to socio-economic conditions. They are more flexible to adopt changes like new method of production, introduction of new products etc.</li>
	<li><b>Resources:</b> Small-scale units use local or indigenous resources and as such can be located anywhere subject to the availability of these resources like labour and raw materials.</li>
	<li><b>Dispersal of units:</b> Small-scale units use local resources and can be dispersed over a wide territory. The development of small-scale units in rural and backward areas promotes more balanced regional development and can prevent the influx of job seekers from rural areas to cities.</li>
</ol>

<h6>Objectives of Small Scale Industries:</h6>
<ul>
The objectives of Small-scale industries are:

	<li>To create more employment opportunities with less investment.</li>
	<li>To remove Economic backwardness of rural and less developed regions of the Economy.</li>
	<li>To reduce regional imbalances.</li>
	<li>To mobilize and ensure optimum utilization of unexploited resources of the country.</li>
	<li>To improve standard of living of people.</li>
	<li>To ensure equitable distribution of income and wealth.</li>
	<li>To solve unemployment problem.</li>
	<li>To attain self-reliance.</li>
	<li>To adopt latest technology aimed at producing better quality products at lower costs.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Problems faced by small-scale industry:</h6>
<ol type="1">
	Small-scale industries play a vital role in the economic development of our country. This sector can stimulate economic activity and is entrusted with the responsibility of realizing various objectives generation of more employment opportunities with less investment, reducing regional imbalances etc. Small-scale industries are not in a position to play their role effectively due to various constraints. The various problems faced by small-scale industries are as under:

	<li><b>Finance:</b> Finance is one of the most important problem confronting small scale industries. Finance is the lifeblood of an organization and no organization can function properly in the absence of adequate funds. The scarcity of capital and inadequate availability of credit facilities are the major causes of this problem. Firstly, adequate funds are not available and secondly, entrepreneurs due to weak economic base have lower credit worthiness.</li>
	<li><b>Raw Materials:</b> Small-scale industries normally tap local sources for meeting raw material requirements. These units have to face numerous problems like availability of inadequate quantity, poor quality and even supply of raw material is not on regular basis. All these factors adversely affect the functioning of these units. Large-scale units, because of more resources, normally corner whatever raw material that is available in the open market.  Small-scale units are thus forced to purchase the same raw material from the open market at very high prices. It will lead to increase in the cost of production thereby making their functioning unviable.</li> 
	<li><b>Idle Capacity:</b> There is under utilization of installed capacity to the extent of 40 to 50 percent in case of small-scale industries. Various causes of this under-utilization are shortage of raw material problem associated with funds and even availability of power. Small-scale units are not fully equipped to overcome all these problems as is the case with the rivals in large-scale sector.</li>
	<li><b>Technology:</b> small-scale entrepreneurs are not fully exposed to the latest technology. Moreover, they lack requisite resources to update or modernize their plant and machinery due to obsolete method of production; they are confronted with the problems of less production in inferior quality and that too at higher cost. They are confronted with problems of less production in inferior quality and that too at higher cost. They are in no position to compete with their better-equipped rivals operating modern large-scale units.</li>
	<li><b>Marketing:</b> These small-scale units are also exposed to marketing problems. They are not in a position to get first-hand information about the market i.e. about the competition, taste, liking, disliking of the consumers and prevalent fashion. With the result, they are not in a position to upgrade their products keeping in mind market requirements. They are producing less of inferior quality and that too at higher costs.</li>	<li><b>Infrastructure:</b> Infrastructure aspects adversely affect the functioning of small-scale units. There is inadequate availability of transportation, communication, power and other facilities in the backward areas. Entrepreneurs are faced with the problem of getting power connections and even when they are lucky enough to get these, they are exposed to unscheduled long power cuts. Inadequate and inappropriate transportation and communication network will make the working of the various units all the more difficult. All these factors are going to adversely affect the quantity, quality and production schedule of enterprises operating in these areas. Thus, their operations will become uneconomical and unviable.</li>
	<li><b>Under Utilization of Capacity:</b> Most of the small-scale units are working below full potentials or there is gross underutilization of capacities. Large-scale units are working for 24 hours a day i.e. in three shifts of 8 hours each and are thus making best possible use of their machinery and equipments. On the other hand, small-scale units are making only 40-50 percent use of their installed capacities.</li>
	<li><b>Project Planning:</b> Another important problem faced by small-scale entrepreneurs is poor project planning. These entrepreneurs do not attach much significance to viability studies i.e. both technical and economical and plunge into entrepreneurial activity out of mere enthusiasm and excitement. They do not bother to study the demand aspect, marketing problems, and sources of raw materials and even availability of proper infrastructure before starting their enterprises. Project feasibility analysis covering all these aspects in addition to technical and financial viability of the projects, is not at all given due weight-age. Inexperienced and incomplete documents, which invariably results in delays in completing promotional formalities.  Small entrepreneurs often submit unrealistic feasibility reports and incompetent entrepreneurs do not fully understand project details. Moreover, due to limited financial resources they cannot afford to avail services of project consultants. This result is poor project planning and execution. There are both time interests of these small-scale enterprises.</li>
	<li><b>Skilled Manpower:</b> A small-scale unit located in a remote backward area may not have problem with respect to unskilled workers, but skilled workers are not available there. The reason is Firstly, skilled workers may be reluctant to work in these areas and secondly, the enterprise may not afford to pay the wages and other facilities demanded by these workers.</li>
	<li><b>Managerial:</b> Managerial inadequacies pose another serious problem for small-scale units. Modern business demands vision, knowledge, skill, aptitude and wholehearted devotion. Competence of the entrepreneur is vital for the success of any venture. An entrepreneur is a pivot around whom the entire enterprise revolves. Many small-scale units have turned sick due to lack of managerial competence on the part of entrepreneurs.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Measures of government:</h6>
<ul>
	<li><b>Policy of Reservation:</b> to shelter them from adverse competition from large units and foreign products, 836 items were reserved for production in SSIs. However in the last decade, more and more items have been de-reserved and better integration of SSIs with world markets has been sought after to raise their competitiveness and efficiency.
	The government in 2015 removed the remaining 20 items from the original list of over 800 items reserved for exclusive production by the MSME sector, thus bringing to an end a policy regime being followed since the 1960s to promote and facilitate the small sector, considered a big employment generator. The de-reservation is being done “to encourage greater investment, incorporate better technologies, standard and branch building and enhance competition in India and global markets for these products,” a Commerce and Industry Ministry statement said.</li>
	<li><b>SIDBI:</b> As umbrella instruction, it provides for the expansion, diversification and modernization of SSIs through providing the refinancing facilities, seed capital, quality certification and factoring services. SSIs are given a priority sector lending status, preference in government purchases and provided domestic factoring services for timely collection of payments besides the various concessions in duties and taxes by the government.</li>
	<li><b>SIDO</b> (Small Industries Development Organization): Provides for technological up gradation and training programmes. Besides, Technological Development and Modernization Fund is set up for upgrading industries like textiles and jute.</li>
	<li><b>District Industries Centres (DICs):</b> To provide all services and support under same roof at district level.</li>
	<li><b>National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC):</b> Provides machinery, market and raw material facilities to SSIs.</li>
	<li><b>1991 Policy:</b> Legislation to ensure payment of small industries bills, market promotion through cooperatives and setting up of an export development centre.
MSME</li>
	<li>With 3.6 crore units spread across the country, that employ 8.05 crore people, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) have a contribution of 37.5 percent to the country’s GDP. The sector has huge potential for helping address structural problems like unemployment, regional imbalances, unequal distribution of national income and wealth across the country. Due to comparatively low capital costs and their forward-backward linkages with other sectors, MSMEs will pay a crucial role in the success of the Make in India initiative.</li>
</ul>
	<li><b>Some of the new initiatives undertaken by the government for the promotion and development of MSMEs, are as follows:</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum (UAM):</b> The UAM scheme, which was notified in September 2015 under section 8 of the MSME Development Act 2006, is a path breaking step to promote ease of doing business for MSMEs. Under the scheme, MSME entrepreneurs just need to file an online entrepreneurs’ memorandum to instantly get an unique Udyog  Aadhaar  Number(UAN). The information sought is on self-certification basis and no supporting documents are required. This marks a significant improvement over the earlier complex and cumbersome procedure.</li>
	<li><b>Employment Exchange for Industries:</b> To facilitate match making between prospective job seekers and employers and employment exchange for industries was launched on June 15, 2015 in line with Digital India. More than 3.42 lakh job seekers have been registered on the portal as on December 30, 2015.</li>
	<li><b>Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs:</b> Under this framework, which was notified in May 2015, banks have to constitute a Committee for Distressed MSME enterprises at zonal or district level to prepare a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for these units.</li>
	<li><b>A scheme for Promoting Innovation and Rural Entrepreneurs (ASPIRE):</b> ASPIRE was launched on March 16, 2015 with the objective of setting up a network of technology centres and incubation and entrepreneurship and promote start-ups for innovation and entrepreneurship in rural and agriculture based industry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
Prime Minister Modi, in a recent interview, indicated that his focus was to create a third sector-the personal sector-other than farms and factories wherein a person turns into a job provider through entrepreneurship rather than a job-seeker in the other two sectors. This statement assumes significance as it has many policy implications for the next few years.
	<li>The government has already been active in translating this vision into reality. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is one of the cornerstones of this policy.</li>
	<li>According to estimates, the total amount of loans disbursed under the PMMY programme crossed Rs. 1.25 trillion as of march 2016.</li>
About the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) scheme:
The PMMY Scheme was launched in April, 2015. The scheme’s objective is to refinance collateral-free loans given by the lenders to small borrowers.
	<li>The scheme, which has a corpus of Rs 20,000 crore, can lend between Rs 50,000 and Rs 10 lakh to small entrepreneurs.</li>
	<li>Banks and MFIs can draw refinance under the MUDRA Scheme after becoming member-lending institutions of MUDRA.</li>
<h6>Significance of this scheme: </h6>

	<li>It will greatly increase the confidence of young, educated or skilled workers who would now be able to aspire to become first generation entrepreneurs.</li>
	<li>Existing small businesses, too, will be able to expand their activities.</li>
	<li>Under the scheme, by floating MUDRA bank, the Centre has ensured credit flow to SMEs sector and has also identified NBFCs as a good fit to reach out to them.</li>
	<li><ol type="1">People will now be able to get refinance at subsidised rate and it would be passed on to the SMEs. Moreover, it would enable SMEs to expand their activities.
There are three types of loans under PMMY:
	<li>Shishu (up to Rs.50,000).</li>
	<li>Kishore (from Rs 50,001 to Rs. 5 lakh0.</li>
	<li>Tarun (from Rs. 500,001 to Rs 10,00,000).</li>
</ol></li>
MUDRA Yojana has to address the following challenges:
	<li>One of the most persistent problems that Indian economy is facing is the inequitable distribution of funds. The larger portion of the capital is available to the bigger companies whereas too little of the capital is distributed to micro, small and medium business sector.</li>
	<li>At present the non-profit micro financing institute (MFI’s) are not able to provide enough support to small business. The commercial banks are also hesitant to provide funds to small and medium entrepreneurs. They avoid exposure to this particular segment because they consider it highly risky in nature with no performance history.</li>
	<li>Even within the organized sector in India, it is larger units that are deploying the most capital, providing the most jobs, wages and emoluments and generating the most output. Also, only 2% of the factories covered by the ASI generate net value-added (NVA) of over Rs.50 crore. They employ a quarter of the total employed in factories, provide 40% of all emoluments: generate half the toatal output from factories and 71% of NVA. Small business hardly come into picture.</li>
	<li>Another problems is that as firms age in India they fail to employ more people. Even as firms become more than three decades old, they do not employ more people. If anything, employment size, relative to the size of employment at the birth of the firm, goes down.</li>
</ul>
Way ahead:
	The government should measure the success or failure of its interventions including Mudra Yojana by the extent of reduction in informal employment, the rise in formal employment and the extent of mobility of firms to medium and large sizes. Objective criteria will help in making these decisions in an apolitical fashion. For that, one of the conditions of the loans must be that entrepreneurs start to maintain books of accounts on employment, output, revenues, expenses and taxes. Government should also bring in policy must be to make them grow out of their sizes at birth.


<ul>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
	
	Under this scheme, Rs. 1.25 trillion disbursements have been done in the space of less than a year. If such rates of growth were maintained, they would constitute a sizeable chunk of total non-farm credit in the economy.
	<ul>
<b>Other initiatives:</b></li>
	<li>Small & Medium Enterprises Fund of Rs. 10,000 cr. Set up to provide credit to SSIs.</li>
	<li>Investment limit raised to Rs. 5 cr. For certain items in sports goods sector to facilitate technological up gradation and enhance competition.</li>
	<li>Enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006.</li>
	<li>Amendment to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act, 1958</li>
</ul>
</ul>
All Activities/Sectors would require prior Government approval for FDI where more than 24% foreign equality is proposed to be inducted for manufacture of items reserved for the Small-Scale Sector.
<ul>
<li><b>Critical Analysis/Suggestions:</b></li>
	
	The fundamental weakness of Small Scale production stems from its small size, which prevents them from benefiting from economics of scale-technological and pecuniary. They are, therefore, cost inefficient relative to larger units. According to World Development Report 2005: The Reservation policy is self-defeating as it motivates small firms to stay small. An end-to-end approach with focus on infrastructural development- financial, technological and institutional, needs to be adopted. Further, the SSIs have high potential both in domestic and foreign markets, which necessitates quality assurance, promotion of brand names and setting up of export cluster. In addition, the information database, training in new products and entrepreneur skill development need to be strengthened to make them regional motors of economic development.
<li><b>Small and Medium Enterprise Policy:</b></li>  
	Small and Medium enterprises play an important role in preventing the concentration of wealth and dispersing the development over geographical plane. These contribute to about 40-50% exports, employment generation and value addition in the manufacturing sector besides provide vital forward-backward linkages in economy. Looking at its importance, GoI has started adopting an integrated approach for their development. S P Gupta committee (2001) too recommended the same. Units with investments in plant machinery between 1 to 10 crores area identified as Medium Scale units are also categorized upto investment of  5 crores (Hosiery, toys). A separate legislation-SME Development act has been enacted in June 2006.
</ul>

<h6>Policy Initiatives:</h6>  

	Act provides that large scale unit must pay their dues within 45 days of procuring wares from SME units, failing which interest at the rate of 15% will be imposed irrespective of whether there was any written agreement to not. Service Units in this sector will be treated at par with manufacturing units. Under the National Manufacturing competitive programme the government has identified 10 schemes to boost technology in this sector & improve their competitiveness by setting up tool Design Centre, Industrial Design Centre in tune with international trends.
<h6>Implementation:</h6>
	SME sector need not obtain a certificate of registration & will be free to shut their business other than those units which have fallen sick. The Act also provides for doing away with inspector Raj as this has proved a source of major harassment.
<h6>Institutional:</h6>
	Act provides for setting up of facilitation council to facilitate recovery of dues from large scale sector & no appeal shall be entertained by large scale without depositing 75% of their outstanding amount a separate credit rating agency SMERA has also been set up.

<h6>Financial:</h6>
<ul> 
•	<li>SME Development Fund (10,000 crores) SIDBI has set up to provide financial assistance at competitive rate.</li>
•	<li>SME Growth Fund (500 crores) SIDBI has set up for technological up-gradation in knowledge based SME units.</li>
•	<li>Credit Guarantee Trust: SIDBI set up to provide guarantee on loans taken by this sector by charging a onetime fee.
Under the Credit Linked Capital subsidy scheme, the %age of subsidy has been hiked from 12 to 15%. This sector is also been encouraged to obtain ISO Certification marks for which government reimburses certain %age of expanses.</li>

<h6>INDUSTRIAL SICKNESS</h6>
<h6>WHAT IS A SICK UNIT?</h6>
	A unit, which having been in existence since for not less than 5 years has incurred losses for 4 consecutive years and has eroded its net worth completely or 50% or more, or has defaulted to repay loans within 9 month is called as sick unit. This includes not only traditional industries like jute, sugar are sick but also modern ones like electrical, cement etc.
	Economic Survey 2015-16 also mentioned this problem as “CHAKRAVYUH CHALLENGE” because of problem to exit. Because of this productive assets (Land, Labour, capital & Entrepreneurship) of a sick firm could not be utilized in another firm.
	<ul>
<li><b>Causes</b></li> 
	The different types of industrial sickness in Small Scale Industry (SSI) fall under two important categories. They are as follows:
<li><b>Internal causes for sickness</b></li>

	We can say pertaining to the factors which are within the control of management. This sickness arises due to internal disorder in the areas justified as following:
•<li><b>Lack of Finance:</b> This including weak equity base, poor utilization of assets, inefficient working capital management, absence of costing & Pricing, absence of planning and budgeting and inappropriate utilization and diversion of funds.</li>
•<li><b>Bad Production Policy:</b> The another very important reason for sickness is wrong selection of site which is related to production, inappropriate plant and machinery, bad maintenance of Plant & Machinery, lack of quality control, lack of standard research & development and so on.</li>
•<li><b>Marketing and Sickness:</b> This is another part, which always affects the health of any sector as well as SSI. This including wrong demand forecasting, selection of inappropriate product mix, absence of product planning, wrong market research methods, and bad sales promotions.</li>
•<li><b>Inappropriate Personnel Management:</b> The another internal reason for the sickness of SSIs is inappropriate personal management policies which includes bad wages and salary administration, bad labour relations, lack of behavioural approach causes dissatisfaction among the employees and workers.</li>
•<li><b>Ineffective Corporate Management:</b> Another reason for the sickness of SSIs is ineffective or bad corporate management, which includes improper corporate planning, lack of integrity in top management, lack of coordination and control etc.</li>

<b>External causes for sickness</b>

•	<li><b>Personnel Constraint:</b> The first foremost important reason for the sickness of small scale industries are non-availability of skilled labour or manpower wages disparity in similar industry and general labour invested in the area.</li>
•	<li><b>Marketing Construction:</b> The second cause for the sickness is related to marketing. The sickness arrives due to liberal licensing policies, restrain of purchase by bulk purchasers, changes in global marketing scenario, excessive tax policies by govt. And market recession.</li>
•	<li><b>Production Constraints:</b> This is another reason for the sickness, which comes under external cause of sickness. This arises due to shortage of raw material, shortage of power, fuel and high prices, import-export restrictions.</li>
•	<li><b>Finance Constraints:</b> Another external cause for the sickness of SSIs is lack of finance. This arises due to credit restrains policy, delay in disbursement of loan by govt., unfavourable investments, fear of nationalization.</li>
•	<li><b>Credit squeeze initiated by the government policies.
Looming Crisis In Textile Sector:</b></li>
	The crisis-ridden textile sector, being labour-intensive, should have been an ideal candidate for a push as part of the Prime Minister’s pet ‘Make in India’ initiative, but as the issues it is mired in remain unresolved, and with losses mounting, the situation is grim. Nearly half of India’s power looms are at a standstill the spinning industry in the northern and southern regions has pressed in shutdowns of as much as 15 to 20 percent of production capacity. The textile industry as a whole is reeling under high input and transaction costs. The products find it hard to compete in export markets, where India-made yarn, fabrics and garments attract duties respectively at rates of 3.5, 8.5 and 14 per cent. Yet, Pakistan, Vietnam and Cambodia enjoy zero-duty access in some categories in the U.S., EU and China.
	Cotton was cheaper in India last year initially. But the Cotton Corporation of India for several months sold the good-quality produce procured in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and parts of Maharashtra at prices higher than international levels, making Indian cotton uncompetitive. This added to the problems of the industry, especially the spinning segment, before an intervention by the Union Textile Ministry ensured resumption of smooth supplies. Tinkering with the cotton market through Minimum Support Price operations must be avoided Instead, direct cash subsidy benefit to farmers could help reform the sector.
	The Technology Up gradation Fund Scheme that was originally brought in by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and lunched in 1999, is a ready framework available to the Centre to address the needs of the textile sector. The scheme, that is estimated to have so far resulted in investments of over Rs. 3,00,000 crore in the whole textile value chain, will expire in March 2017. It should be extended. A comprehensive National Textile Policy must be announced at the earliest to create a level playing field with regard to tariff rates, raw material costs, cost of funding and transaction costs. Each power loom provides work to about 2.5 workers. Closures all across the country could endanger livelihoods on a large scale.  Conversely, a healthy textile sector could potentially create millions of jobs. That should be the target.

<h6>Parliament passes the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</h6> 
	The objective of the new law is to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit, and balance the interests of all stakeholders by consolidating and amending the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner and for maximization of value of assets of such persons and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
The law aims to consolidate the laws relating to insolvency of companies and limited liability entities (including limited liability partnerships and other entities with limited liability), unlimited liability partnerships and individuals, presently contained in a number of legislations, into a single legislation. Such consolidation will provide for a greater clarity in law and facilitate the application of consistent and coherent provisions to different stakeholders affected by business failure or inability to pay debt.
<h6>The salient features of the law are as follows:</h6>
<ol type="i"> 
i.<li>	Clear, coherent and speedy process for early identification of financial distress and resolution of companies and limited liability entities if the underlying business is found to be viable.</li>
ii.<li>	Two distinct processes for resolution of individuals, namely- “Fresh Start” and “Insolvency Resolution”.</li>
iii.<li>	Debt Recovery Tribunal and National Company Law Tribunal to act as adjudicating Authority and deal with the cases related to insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy process in respect of individuals and unlimited partnership firms and in respect of companies and limited liabilities entities respectively.</li>
iv.<li>	Establishment of an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India to exercise regulatory oversight over insolvency professionals, insolvency professional agencies and information utilities.</li>
v.<li>	Insolvency professionals would handle the commercial aspects of insolvency resolution process. Insolvency professional agencies will develop professional standards, code of ethics and be first level regulator for insolvency professionals members leading to development of a competitive industry for such professionals.</li>
vi.<li>	Information utilities would collect, collate, authenticate and disseminate financial information to be used in insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
vii.<li>	Enabling provisions to deal with cross border insolvency.</li>

A key innovation of the insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is four pillars of institutional infrastructure:-
		The first pillar of institutional infrastructure is a class of regulated persons, the ‘Insolvency Professionals’. They would play a key role in the efficient working of the bankruptcy process. They would be regulated by ‘insolvency Professional Agencies’.
		The second pillar of institutional infrastructure is a new industry of ‘Information Utilities’. These would store facts about lenders and terms of lending in electronic databases.
		The third pillar of institutional infrastructure is in adjudication. The NCLT will be the forum where firm insolvency will be heard and DRTs will be the forum where individual insolvencies will be heard. These institutions, along with their Appellate bodies, viz., NCLAT and DRATs will be adequately strengthened so as to achieve world class functioning of the bankruptcy process.
		The fourth pillar of institutional infrastructure is a regulator viz., ‘The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India’. This body will have regulatory over-sight over the Insolvency Professional, Insolvency Professional agencies and information utilities.
		The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is thus a comprehensive and systemic reform, which will give a quantum leap to the functioning of the credit market. It would take India from among relatively weak insolvency regimes to becoming one of the world’s best insolvency regimes. It lays the foundations for the development of the corporate bond market, which would finance the infrastructure projects of the future. The passing of this Code and implementation of the same will give a big boost to ease of doing business in India.
