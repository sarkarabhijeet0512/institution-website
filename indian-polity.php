<p>A constitution defines the principles upon which the State is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the State. Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world, while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution. All the democratic constitutions can be divided into two categories: &nbsp;</p>

  <div class="menu-content Making"><h1>CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Composition of the Constituent Assembly</strong></p>
<p>The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under the Scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan. The Mission recommended that the representation of the provinces in the constitution-making body be on the basis of population, roughly in the ratio of one Member to a million. The seats allocated to the provinces be divided among the principal communities, classified for this purpose as Sikhs, Muslims and General (all except Sikhs and Muslims), on the basis of their numerical strength. The representatives of each community were to be chosen by members of that community in the provincial assembly and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation with single transferable vote. The number of members allotted to the Indian State was also to be fixed on the same basis of population as adopted for British India, but the method of their select ion was to be settled later by consultation.</p>
<p>The strength of the constitution-making body was to be 389. Of these 296 representatives were to be from British India (292 representatives drawn from the eleven Governor&rsquo;s Provinces of British India and a representative each from the four Chief Commissioners&rsquo; Provinces of Delhi, Ajmer-Marwara, Coorg and British Baluchistan) and 93 representatives from the Indian States.</p>
<p><strong>Working of the Constituent Assembly</strong></p>
<p>The Constituent Assembly duly opened on the ninth day of December 1946 at eleven in the morning. The Muslim League members did not attend, and the Constituent Assembly began to function with the Non-Muslim League members.</p>
<p>According to June 3, 1947 Plan, the representatives of the Muslim majority areas of the two Provinces (i.e., West Punjab and East Bengal) voted for partition and for joining a new Constituent Assembly. The referendum in the North Western Frontier and Sylhet was in favour of Pakistan. On the 26th July, 1947, the Governor-General announced the sitting up of a separate Constituent Assembly for Pakistan.</p>
<p>Following the members of the Muslim League Party from the Indian Dominion also took their seats in the assembly. The representative of some of the Indian states had already entered the assembly on 28th April, 1947. By 15August, 1947 most of the States were represented in the assembly and the remaining states also sent their representatives in due course.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was attended by only 211 members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Sachchidanand Sinha was elected as the Temporary President of the Assembly.</p>
<p>On December 11, 1946, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and H.C. Mukherjee were elected as the President and Vice-President of the Assembly respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sir B.N.&nbsp; Rau was appointed as the Constitutional Adviser to the Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The historic Objectives Resolution was moved in the Constituent Assembly by Nehru, on 13th December, 1946. It laid down the fundamentals and philosophy of the constitutional structures.</p>
<p><strong>Framing the Constitution</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution Assembly appointed a number of Committees on procedural and substantive matters to deal with different aspects of the problem of framing the constitution. Out of these, eight were major committees and the others were minor committees. The report of these committees formed the basis on which the first draft of the Constitution was prepared. These were as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Major Committees</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Union Powers Committee, Chairman &ndash; Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
    <li>Union Constitution Committee, Chairman - Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
    <li>Provincial Constitution Committee, Chairman &ndash; Sardar Patel</li>
    <li>Drafting Committee, Chairman &ndash; Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</li>
    <li>Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights and Minorities, Chairman &ndash; Sardar Patel. This committee had two sub-committees:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee, Chairman &ndash; J.B. Kripalani</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;Minorities Sub-Committee, Chairman- H.C. Mukherjee</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rules of procedure Committee, Chairman &ndash; Dr. Rajendra Prasad</li>
    <li>States Committee (Committee for Negotiating with States), Chairman- Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
    <li>Steering Committee, Chairman &ndash; Dr. Rajendra Prasad</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drafting Committee</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Committees worked as standing Committees. Only the Drafting Committee functioned till the end of the constitution making. It was this committee that was entrusted with the task of preparing a draft of the new Constitution. This committee had the following members:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Chairman)</li>
    <li>N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar</li>

  <div class="menu-content Preamble"><h1>THE PREAMBLE</h1><hr>
<p>Preamble is an integral part of the constitution. In it mentioned are the great ideals which our constitution desires to follow. The concept of India being a democratic state has its roots in the preamble. It provides the basic ideology upon which the entire constitution rests. Secularism, Sovereignty and Socialism as the state goals are enshrined in here. The guarantee of Equality, Freedom and Liberty are woven in here.</p>
<p>     It reads, &lsquo;WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA , having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; LIBERTY of thought, expression , belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all, FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation: IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION&rsquo;.</p>
<p ><strong>Preamble is a part of the Constitution</strong></p>
<p><strong>    </strong>Dr. D.D. Basu holds the view that &ldquo;a statute must be read as a whole and a Preamble is as much a part of the statute as its enacting part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    The proceedings in the Constituent Assembly make it clear that the Preamble to our Constitution was adopted and enacted in the same manner as the rest of the Constitution. The Preamble was put to vote in the Constituent Assembly by a motion which stated that the &ldquo;<strong>Preamble stands part of the</strong> <strong>Constitution</strong>&rdquo; and the motion was adopted. It appears that this fact was not brought to the notice of the Supreme Court in <strong>Berubari Union case</strong>, wherein the Supreme Court had held that the Preamble was not a part of the Constitution and therefore it could never be regarded as a source of any substantive powers conferred on government under the provisions of the Constitution. Later, when the history of the drafting and the ultimate adoption of Preamble were brought to the notice of the Supreme Court in the <strong>Kesavananda Bharti case, the court laid down that the Preamble to the Indian Constitution was an integral part of the Constitution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>    </strong>Thus, after the observation of the Supreme Court in this case, there remains no doubt that the Preamble to the Indian Constitution is a part of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Amendment of the Preamble</strong></p>
<p><strong>   </strong>It was contended in Berubarui Union Case that the Preamble though a part of the Constitution, but was not a provision of the Constitution and, therefore, it could not be amended by the Parliament under Article 368. Rejecting the contention the court in Kesavananda Bharti case held that being a part of the Constitution, the Preamble was not outside the reach of the amending power of the Parliament under Article 368. It was in the exercise of this amending power that the Constitution (42<sup>nd</sup> Amendment) Act, 1976 amended the preamble inserting therein the terms &lsquo;<strong>Socialist</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>Secular</strong>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<strong>integrity</strong>&rsquo;.</p></div>
  <div class="menu-content Union"><h1>UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA</h1><hr>
<p>Out of the above seven Union Territories, National Capital Territory of Delhi and Puducherry have Legislatures, Council of Ministers and Consolidated Funds. The rest of the Union Territories are without Legislature.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Citizenship">agri</div>
  <div class="menu-content Fundamental"><h1>FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS</h1><hr>
<p>Rights are necessary for the very sustenance of a democracy. In a democracy every citizen has to have the right to vote and the right to be elected to government. For democratic elections to take place it is necessary that citizens should have the right to express their opinion, form political parties and take part in political activities. Rights also perform a very special role in a democracy. Rights protect minorities from the oppression of majority. They ensure that the majority cannot do whatever it likes. Rights are guarantees which can be used when things go wrong. In most democracies the basic rights of the citizen are written down in the constitution. Constitution provides for <strong>six Fundamental Rights</strong>.</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right to Equality and Constitutional Provisions</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Article 14&nbsp;</strong>provides for Equality before law. The State shall not dent to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Equality before law is a negative concept in the parlance of governance because it forces a state to provide these rights and in case state defaults then there are judicial safeguards for the citizens to claim their rights. It is based on the concept of Rule of law. The concept has been borrowed from United Kingdom&rsquo;s Constitution. It signifies that no one is above the law.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 15&nbsp;</strong>provides for prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth or any of them. This right is available only to citizens. But there is an exception to it. Exception as is provided in Article 15(3) and Article 15(4). Article 15(3) says that nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children. Article 15(4) says that nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Schedule Caste and the Schedule Tribes.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Article 16&nbsp;</strong>provides for <strong>equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.&nbsp;</strong>There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under State. This right is available only to citizens. There are few exceptions to it. Article 16(3) says nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an office under the Government of, or any local or other authority within, a State or Union Territory, any requirement as to residence within that State or Union Territory prior to such employment or appointment. Article 16(4) says nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, there is Article 16(4A). It states that nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Article 17</strong> provides for <strong>abolition of untouchability</strong>. It is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. The Parliament enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955. This act was amended by the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1976, in order to make the law more stringent to remove the evil of untouchability from the society. It has been renamed as, The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955. The Protection of Civil Rights Act prescribes punishment which may extend to imprisonment upto six months and also with a fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or both.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 18&nbsp;</strong>provides for <strong>abolition of titles</strong>. Article 18 is not Penal in return but only directly in nature.</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right to Freedom</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Freedom means absence of constraints. In practical life it means absence of interference in our affairs by others be it other individuals or the government. We want to live in society, but we want to be free. We want to do things in the way we want to do them. Others should not dictate us what we should do.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Freedom in Indian Institution under Article 19</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Freedom of speech and expression&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Assembly in a peaceful manner</li>
    <li>Form associations and unions or cooperatives</li>
    <li>Move freely throughout the country</li>
    <li>Reside in any part of the country</li>
    <li>Practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Freedom of Speech and Expression: Scope and Content</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The right to freedom of speech and expression has been subjected to wide interpretations by the Supreme Court.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Freedom of Press</li>
    <li>Right to know and to obtain information</li>
    <li>Right of citizens/ voters to know the antecedents of the candidates at the time of election</li>
    <li>Right to reply or answer criticism against one&rsquo;s views</li>
    <li>Demonstrations and Picketing</li>
    <li>No Right to call or enforce band, hartals, blockades</li>
    <li>Freedom of Silence</li>
    <li>Right of a convict to express himself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasonable Restrictions</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In the interest of the security of country</li>
    <li>Friendly relations with foreign States</li>
    <li>For the maintenance of public order, morality and decency</li>
    <li>On the grounds of contempt of Court and defamation&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Instigating violence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Article 20</strong> of the Constitution says that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the Act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Available to all individuals and cannot be suspended even during emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Life and Personal Liberty</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Article 21&nbsp;</strong>of the Constitution says that no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. It means that no person can be killed unless the court has ordered a death sentence. Available to all individuals and cannot be suspended even during emergency. Even when they do, they have to follow some procedures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A person who is arrested and detained in custody will have to be informed of the reasons for such arrest and detention.</li>
    <li>A person who is arrested and detained shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of arrest.</li>
    <li>Such a person has the right to consult a lawyer or engage a lawyer for his defence.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supreme Court has extended the scope of &ldquo;Right to life&rdquo; by making Article 21 repositories of all other important rights that are not explicitly mentioned in the constitution such as Right to dignified life, Right to privacy, Right to clean environment etc.</p>
<p><strong>Protection against Arrest and Detention</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 22&nbsp;</strong>of the Constitution says that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as possible, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions and Preventive Detention</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Article 22 of the Constitution these rights are not available to the enemy aliens and secondly the persons detained under the preventive detention laws. Preventive detention means the detention of a person without trial in such circumstances that the evidence in possession of the authority is not sufficient to make a legal charge.</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right against Exploitation</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Once the right to liberty and equality is granted, it follows that every citizen has a right not to be exploited. Yet the Constitution makers thought it was necessary to write down certain clear provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society. The Constitution mentions three specific evils and declares these illegal. In Article 23 first, the Constitution prohibits &lsquo;traffic in human beings&rsquo;. Traffic here means selling and buying of human beings, usually women, for immoral purposes. Second, our Constitution also prohibits forced labour or beggar in any form.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;Begar&rsquo; is a practice where the worker is forced to render service to the &lsquo;master&rsquo; free of charge or at a nominal remuneration. When this practice takes place on a life-long basis, it is called the practice of bonded labour.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, in Article 24, the Constitution also prohibits child labour. No one can employ a child below the age of fourteen to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous work. Such as railways and ports. Using this as a basis many laws have been made to prohibit children from working in industries such as beedi making, firecrackers and matches, printing and dyeing.</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right to Freedom of Religion</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 25 of the Constitution gives freedom of conscience. It guarantees practice and propagation of religion. But it is subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 26 assures freedom to manage religious affairs. Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;</li>
    <li>To manage its own affairs in matters of religion;</li>
    <li>To own and acquire movable and immovable property; and</li>
    <li>To administer such property in accordance with law.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the affair of these institutions can be regulated for the maintenance of public order, decency etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 27 gives freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion. It says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Article 28 gives freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institutions wholly maintained out of State funds.</li>
    <li>Nothing in above shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution.</li>
    <li>No person attending any educational institution recognized by the State or receiving and out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cultural and Educational Rights</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>It is the language, culture and religion of minorities that needs special protection. Otherwise, they may get neglected or undermined under the impact of the language, religion and culture of the majority. That is the way the Constitution under Article 29 specifies the cultural and educational right of the minorities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any section of citizens with a distinct language or culture has a right to conserve it.</li>
    <li>Admission to any educational institution maintained by government or receiving government aid cannot be denied to any citizen on the ground of religion or language.</li>
    <li>All minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here minority does not means both linguistic and religious.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 30 provides for a right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions. It states that all minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Further Article 30(2) provides that the State shall not in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These rights are also known as minority rights. The objective behind Article 29 and 30, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, is the recognition and preservation of the different types of people with diverse languages and different beliefs which constitute the essence of secularism in India.</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right to Constitutional Remedies&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>One would agree that our Constitution contains a very impressive list of Fundamental Rights. But merely writing down a list of rights is not enough. There has to be a way through which they could be realized in practice and defended against any attack on these rights. Right to constitutional remedies is the means through which this is to be achieved. Dr. Ambedkar considered the right to constitutional remedies as &lsquo;heart and soul of the constitution&rsquo;. It is so because this right gives a citizen the right to approach a High Court or Supreme Court to get any of the fundamental rights restored in case of their violation. The Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue orders and give directives to the government for the enforcement of rights. The courts can issue various special orders known as writs.</p>
<p><strong>Writs</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Habeas corpus:&nbsp;</strong>A writ of habeas corpus means that the court orders that the arrested person should be presented before it. It can also order to set free an arrested person if the manner or grounds of arrest are not lawful or satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Mandamus:&nbsp;</strong>This writ is issued when the court finds that a particular office holder is not doing legal duty and thereby is infringing on the right of an individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Prohibition:</strong> This writ is issued by a higher court (High Court or Supreme Court) when a lower court has considered a case going beyond its jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quo Warranto:&nbsp;</strong>If the court finds that a person is holding office but is not entitled to hold that office, it issues the writ of quo warranto and restricts that person from acting as an office holder.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certiorari:&nbsp;</strong>Under this writ, the court orders a lower court or another authority to transfer a matter pending before it to the higher authority or court.</p>
<p><strong>Writ Jurisdiction of Supreme Court and High Courts</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Under article 32 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights only. On the other hand, under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Courts have been empowered to issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights as well as other legal rights of the individuals. Thus, the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts is wider than that of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under Article 32 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is bound to issue writs if an individual approaches the Apex Court on the violation of the Fundamental Rights. On the other hand, under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Courts are not bound to issue writs. They can suggest some alternatives also. Thus, the Supreme Court has been made the custodian or the guardian of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Originally there were seven fundamental rights but at present there number stand at six. Right to property is no longer a fundamental right. It is a legal right. The right to property was deleted from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44<sup>th</sup> Amendment Act, 1978. It is made a legal right under Article 300A in Para XII of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Doctrine of Basic Structure of the Constitution</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Supreme Court in <strong>Kesavananda Bharti made a judicial innovation.&nbsp;</strong>This gave rise to the &lsquo;doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution&rsquo;. It held that the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is limited to the extent of not violating the basic structure of the Constitution. However, the court did not elaborate on what constitutes the basic structure of the Constitution. Court considers every legislation on case to case basis. Some of the judgements have withheld that Supremacy of constitution, Rule of law, Secularis etc. are part of the basic structure.</p>
<p><strong>Judicial Review and Fundamental Rights</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Judicial review is the power of Supreme Court and High Courts to declare a law as unconstitutional or void, if it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Constitution to the extent of such inconsistency. This power is available both against the law made by the legislature and an act of the executive.</p>
<p><strong>Armed Forces and Fundamental Rights</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Article 33&nbsp;</strong>empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the fundamental rights of the members of armed forces, paramilitary forces, police forces, intelligence agencies and analogous forces. The objective of this provision is to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The power to make laws under Article 33 is conferred only on Parliament and not on state legislatures. Any such law made by Parliament cannot be challenged in any court on the ground of contravention of any of the fundamental rights.</p></div>
  <div class="menu-content Dpsp"><h1>DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY (DPSP)</h1>
<hr>
<p>Part IV of the Constitution relates to the Directive Principles of State Policy. It set forth the ideals and objectives to be achieved by the State for setting up in India a Social welfare state, as distinguished from a mere police State.</p>
<p>inspiration for including the Directive Principles in the Constitution is drawn from the <strong>Constitution of Ireland</strong>. The Directive Principles are meant to be the fundamental principles which should necessarily be made the basis of all executive and legislative actions that may be taken in the governance of the country.</p>
<p><strong>The 42<sup>nd</sup> Amendment</strong>, which came into force in January 1977, attempted to raise the status of the Directive Principles by stating that no law implementing any of the Directive Principles could be declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated any of the Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>DPSP has been classified under following headings:</p>
<p><strong>Socialist Principles</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 38:&nbsp;</strong>States to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people.</p>

    <li>That the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment;</li>
    <li>That there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women;</li>
    <li>That the health and strength of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength;</li>
    <li>Those children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood any youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.</li>
</ul>

    <li>They are non-justifiable.</li>
</ul></div>
  <div class="menu-content Duties"><h1>FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES</h1><hr>
<p>Rights and Duties go hand in hand. They are like two sides of a same coin. In India 40 years after independence it was felt that there was a definite need to make the people more conscious of their<strong>duties to</strong>wards the nation. In February 1976 <strong>the Swaran Singh Committee</strong> was established for suggesting constitutional reforms. In its report published in May 1976, this committee recommended, the incorporation of fundamental duties of the people of India.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Is a citizen of India,</li>
    <li>Has completed the age of thirty- five years, and&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Is qualified for election as a member of the House of the People.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Article 58(2):&nbsp;</strong>States that a person shall not be eligible for election President if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.</p>
<p><strong>Election of the President</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Articles 54, 55 and 71&nbsp;</strong>of the Constitution deal with the election of the President. Apart from these provisions the Parliament has also enacted certain laws regulating the election of the President. The <strong>nominated members and the MLCs do not participate</strong> in the presidential election.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Article 54 reads &ndash; The President shall be elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The elected members of both Houses of Parliament; and</li>
    <li>The elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 70<sup>th</sup> Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 1992 gave voting rights to MLA&rsquo;s of Delhi and Puducherry for election of President. Thus in this Article &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Puducherry.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Article 55</strong> deals with the method of the President&rsquo;s election. The President is elected by Proportional Representation with single transferable vote system. Proportional representation means that in order to get elected the candidate must get quota of votes i.e., more than 50% of valid votes. Under the Single Transferable Vote system an elector can indicate more than one preference on his ballot paper. He can make as many preferences as the number of candidates are. However, he must not mention all preferences. At least one preference must be made for the validity of votes.</p>
<p><strong>Values of vote of one MLA</strong>= Total Population of the States/ total number of elected MLAs * 1/1000.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Values of vote of one MP</strong>= Total value of votes of all the MLAs/Total Number of elected MPs.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Article 71(1)</strong>, all doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p><strong>Article 71(2)</strong> states that if the election of a person as President or Vice- President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of the office of President or Vice- President, as the case may be, on or before the date of the decision of the Supreme Court shall not be invalidated by reason of that declaration.</p>
<p><strong>Term of office of the President</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The President shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office but he is eligible for re-election.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The President may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Vice- President, resign his office;</li>
    <li>The President may, for violation of the Constitution, be removed from office by impeachment in the manner provided in Article 61;</li>
    <li>The President shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to <strong>Article 56(2)</strong> any resignation addressed to the Vice-President under clause (a) of the provision to clause (1) shall forthwith be communicated by him to the Speaker of the House of the People.</p>
<p><strong>Powers and Position of President</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The powers and functions that have been vested in the President of India may be classified under the following heads: executive powers, legislative powers, military powers, diplomatic powers, judicial powers, financial powers and emergency powers.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 53</strong> of the constitution lays down that the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President thus making him the head of the executive. All executive actions of the Union must be expressed to be taken in the name of the President and as such he shall have a right to be informed of the affairs of the Union. The executive power includes the power to appoint and remove the high constitutional authority of the country. Under this power he appoints the Prime Minister and other members of the Council of Ministers and distributes portfolios among them. He also appoints the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court in the States.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The President of India is an integral part of the Union Parliament. The Parliament cannot function without involving him. He alone can summon and prorogue the Houses of Parliament. If there is a deadlock in the process of legislation between both the Houses of Parliament, the President has the power to summon a joint session to do away with the impasse. He addresses both the Houses on the inaugural session after each general election and presents the agenda of the government. Apart from this he can send messages to either Houses of Parliament on any important matter of national, constitutional or public interest. The constitution requires the previous sanction of the President for introducing certain legislations for example a bill which seeks to create a new state or change the boundary of an existing state or change the name of a state or dealing with certain matters relating of Fundamental Rights. Money bills also require the previous sanction of the President before its introduction in the Lower House. Besides this all bills after they are passed in the Parliament need his consent to become Acts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The President can also promulgate ordinances during the recess of the Parliament. Ordinance is an emergent legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further he causes some important reports to be submitted on the floor of the Lok Sabha. The reports of Comptroller and Auditor General, Finance Commission, Union Public Service Commission, Language Commission are some of the many reports caused by the President to be laid before the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Military Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Constitution vests the Supreme Command of the Defence Force in the President of India. As such he makes all important appointments in the Defence Force including the Chief of the three wings: the Armed Force, the Air Force and the Naval Force. He can declare war and conclude peace. However, the President cannot do so himself. Under the Constitution he is required to do so under the control and authority of the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Judicial Powers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The President of India as head of the executive enjoys some judicial powers like most other heads of democratic countries the world over. The purpose of granting such powers to the President is to rectify the possible judicial errors. No human system of judicial administration can ever be foolproof. The president of India can grant pardons, reprieves or respites or remission of punishment. He can suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence in cases where the punishment is by a court martial or death sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>With regard to his powers in the field of finance the constitution provides that all money bills will need his consent to be initialed in the Lower House of Parliament. He causes the budget to be laid on the floors of Lok Sabha every financial year. He is empowered to order for the presentation of the report of the Auditor General of India relating to the accounts of the Government of India. The Finance Commission submits its report containing its recommendations and actions taken for his placement in the legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Contingency Fund of India is at his disposal. He can make advances out of it to meet the unforeseen expenditure.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The makers of Indian Constitution were influenced by the relevant provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935 and the Constitution of Weimer Republic of Germany where such provisions had been incorporated. In the Constitution of India three kinds of emergencies have been envisaged such as National Emergency, State Emergency and Financial Emergency.</p>
<p><strong>>Discretionary Powers of President</strong></p>

<p><strong>Appointment of Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In normal circumstances, after the general elections, when a pre-poll coalition or a single party gets majority in the Lok Sabha then the President is bound to invite the leader of that coalition or the political Party to form a government but when there is hung Parliament President have the discretion to call upon the leader who he thinks can form the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Power to send a Bill for the Reconsideration of Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The President can send a bill other than a money bill or a constitutional amendment bill for the reconsideration of Parliament only for once. The former President Abdul Kalam sent the Office of Profit bill for the reconsideration of Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Pocket Veto</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>When an ordinary bill after being passed by the Parliament goes to the President for his/her assent, he/she can give his/her assent or he/she may declare that he/she is withholding the assent, or he/she may send the bill for the reconsideration of Parliament only for once.</p>
<p><strong>Dissolution of the Lok Sabha</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> In normal circumstances the President dissolves the Lok Sabha on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers but he is not bound to follow the advice of the Council of Minsters which has lost the vote of confidence in the lower house. Here the President will look that whether an alternative government can be formed or not.</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment of the President&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Article 61&nbsp;</strong>deals with the impeachment of the President. The President can be impeached on the grounds of violation of the Constitution. The impeachment motion can be brought about in the form of resolution in either House of the Parliament. It must be supported by not less than &frac14; of the total strength of the House for its introduction. This resolution can be passed with a special majority of not less than 2/3 of the total strength of the House voting in favour of the impeachment motion. It can be passed only after the expiry of the 14 days notice served to the President.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime the other House acts as an investigating House. It investigates the charges itself or appoints a committee to investigate. The President has the right to defend himself in this House through an attorney of his choice or personally. If the second House also passes the resolution after investigation by not less than 2/3 of the total strength of the House, then from that day the President is considered to be impeached. It is s quasi-judicial process as the second House acts as the investigating House.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Prime Minister theoretically holds office during the pleaser of the President Actually the Prime Minister stays in office as long as he enjoys the confidence of the Parliament. The normal term is five years but it is automatically reduced if the house is dissolved earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Powers</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Prime Minister enjoys extensive powers.</li>
    <li>He is the Leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha.</li>
    <li>He can recommend the dissolution of Lok Sabha to the President before expiry of its normal term.</li>
    <li>All the members of the Council of Ministers are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.</li>
    <li>He allocates portfolios among the various ministers and reshuffles them according to his wishes. He can ask a minister to resign and even get him dismissed by the President.</li>

    <li>The Prime Minister is the chief channel of communication between the President and the Council of Ministers and keeps the former informed about all the decisions of the council.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Council of Ministers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A minister must be a member of either House of Parliament. If a person who is not a member of either House of Parliament is appointed a minister, he shall cease to be a minister after six months, unless in the meanwhile he manages to get elected to either of the two Houses Ministers may be chosen from members of either House or a Ministers may be chosen from members of either House or a Minister who is a member of one House, has right to speak in and to take part in the proceedings of the other House though he has no right to vote in the House of which he is not member.</p>
<p>There are three types of Council of Ministers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cabinet Ministers</strong>: Cabinet Ministers are the senior most ministers and they always head the departments or the Ministers if they are given one. A Cabinet Minister can be without a portfolio also. The Cabinet Ministers can take part in the cabinet meetings as a matter of right. The cabinet enjoys a constitutional status under Article 352, which says that the President can proclaim National Emergency on the written advice of the Cabinet.</li>

<p><strong>Principles on which the Cabinet System of Government Functions</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The parliamentary form of government is based on the principle of collective responsibility. Article 75(3) states that the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. It means that all the Ministers are collectively answerable to the Lok Sabha for the policies and decisions of the government, even though a decision taken may pertain to a single ministry. The individual ministers may have differences among themselves on certain issues but once a decision is taken by the cabinet it becomes a joint decision of all the Ministers. If a minister does not agree with the decision of the cabinet he has no choice, but to resign. The Council of Ministers works as a team. Thus it swims or sinks together.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Responsibility of Ministers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Apart from collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, all ministers are individually responsible to the President. Article 75(2) declares that the ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President.</p></div>

  <div class="menu-content Committes"><h1>COMMITTEES OF THE PARLIAMENT</h1><hr>
<p>The work done by the Parliament in modern times is not only varied in nature, but considerable in volume. The time at its disposal is limited. It cannot therefore give close consideration to all the legislative and other matters that come up before it. A good deal of its business is therefore transacted by what are called the Parliamentary Committees. Parliamentary Committees are of two kinds:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ad hoc Committees, and</li>
    <li>The Standing Committees</li>
</ul>
<p>Ad hoc Committee is appointed for a specific purpose and they cease to exist when they finish the tasks assigned to them and submit a report. The principal Ad hoc Committees are the Select and Joint Committees on Bills. Others like the Railway Convention Committee, the Committees on the Draft Five Year Plans and the Hindi Equivalents Committees were appointed for specific purposes. Apart from the Ad hoc Committees, each House of Parliament has Standing Committees like the Business Advisory Committee, the Committee on Petitions, the Committee of Privileges and the Rules Committee, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and Functions of Select and Joint Committees</strong></p>
<p>When a Bill comes up before a House for general discussion, it is open to that House to refer it to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint Committee of the two Houses. A motion has to be moved and adopted to this effect in the House in which the Bill comes up for consideration. In case the motion adopted is for reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee, the decision is conveyed to the other House requesting them to nominate members of the other House to serve on the Committee. The Select or Joint Committee considers the Bill clause by clause just as the two Houses do. Amendments can be moved to various clauses by members of the Committee. The Committee can also take evidence of associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the Bill. After the Bill has thus been considered the Committee submits its report to the House. Members who do not agree with the majority report may append their minutes of dissent to the report.</p>
<p><strong>Committee on Estimates</strong></p>
<p>This Committee consists of 30 members who are elected by the Lok Sabha every year from amongst its members. A Minister is not eligible for election to this Committee. The term of the Committee is one year. The main function of the Committee on Estimates is to report what economies, improvements in organization, efficiency, or administrative reform, consistent with the policy underlying the estimates may be effected and to suggest alternative policies in order to bring about efficiency and economy in administration. From time to time the Committee selects such of the estimates pertaining to a Ministry or a group of Ministries or the statutory and other Government bodies as may seem fit to the Committee. The Committee also examines matters of special interests which may arise or come to light in the course of its work or which are specifically referred to it by the House or the Speaker.</p>
<p><strong>Committee on Public Undertakings</strong></p>
<p>The Committee on Public Undertaking consists of 15 members. 10 members are elected by the Lok Sabha and 5 members of Rjya Sabha are associated with it. A Minister is not eligible for election to this Committee. The term of the Committee is one year. The functions of the Committee on Public Undertakings are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To examine the reports and accounts of Public Undertakings are;</li>
    <li>To examine the reports, if any, of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Public Undertakings;</li>
    <li>To examine in the context of the autonomy and efficiency of the Public Undertakings whether the affairs of the Public Undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices; and</li>
    <li>Such other functions vested in the Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Estimates in relation to the Public Undertakings as are not covered by clauses (a), (b) &amp; (c) above and as may be allotted to the Committee by the Speaker from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee does not, however, examine matters of major Government policy and matters of day-to-day administration of the Undertakings. The Committee is headed by a member of Lok Sabha who is from the Opposition parties.</p>
<p><strong>Committee on Public Accounts</strong></p>
<p>This Committee consists of 15 members elected by the Lok Sabha and 7 members of the Rajya Sabha are associated with it. A Minister is not eligible for election to this Committee. The term of the Committee is one year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main duty of the Committee is to ascertain whether the money granted by Parliament has been spent by Government within the scope of the Demand. The Appropriation Accounts of the Government of India and the Audit Reports presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General mainly from the basis for the examination of the Committee. Cases involving losses, nugatory expenditure and financial irregularities come in for severe criticism by the Committee. &nbsp;The Committee is not concerned with questions of policy. It is concerned only with the execution of the policy laid down by Parliament and its results.</p></div>

  <div class="menu-content Supreme"><p><strong>Supreme Court</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of the land as established by Part V, Chapter IV of the Constitution of India. According to the Constitution of India, the role of the Supreme Court of India is that of a federal court, guardian of the Constitution and the highest court of appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <strong>Article 124(2)</strong>, every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty-five years:</p>
<p>Provided that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.</p>
<p><strong>Qualification of the Judges</strong></p>
<p>According to Article 124(3), a person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court unless he is a citizen of India and</p>
<ul>
    <li>Has been for at least five years a Judge of High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession; or&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Has been for at least ten years an advocate of a High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession; or</li>
    <li>In the opinion of the President, a distinguished jurist.</li>

<p><strong>Article 124(4)</strong> is an incomplete provision. <strong>Article 124(5)&nbsp;</strong>authorizes the Parliament to regulate by law providing for the procedure for the introduction of the resolution and the proof of misbehavior or incapacity. Accordingly, the Parliament enacted the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968. The Act contains the procedure to be adopted for the passage of resolution in the Parliament.</p>

However, for its introduction in the Lok Sabha , it should be supported by not less than 100 members of the House and if it is introduced in the Rjya Sabha, it must be supported by not less than 50 members of the House. After its proper introduction the presiding officer shall appoint a Judicial Committee to investigate charges against the Judge. The committee is headed by a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court. The second member can be a sitting Judge of either the Supreme Court or High Court and the third member can be an eminent jurist. The concerned Judge has the right to defend himself before the judicial committee. After the presentation of the report of the Committee, both the Houses can pass the resolution by the majority mentioned under Article 124(4). On the passage of the resolution, the President can remove the concerned Judge.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Review"><h1>THE JUDICIARY</h1><hr>
<p>Courts take decisions on a very large number of issues. They can decide that no teacher can beat a student, or about the sharing of river waters between states, or they can punish people for particular crimes. Broadly speaking, the work that the judiciary does can be divided into the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dispute Resolution between Centre and States; State and States.</li>
    <li>As the final interpreter of the Constitution, the judiciary also has the power to strike down particular laws passed by the Parliament if it believes that these are a violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is called <strong>judicial review</strong>.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Upholding the Law and Enforcing Fundamental Rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An Independent Judiciary</strong></p>
<p>The control that the politician holds over the Judge does not allow for the Judge to take an independent decision. This lack of independence would force the Judge to make all judgments in favour of the politician. Although we often hear of rich and powerful people in India trying to influence the judicial process, the Indian Constitution protects against this kind of situation by providing for the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p>One aspect of this independence is the &lsquo;separation of power&rsquo;. What this means here is that other branches of the State - like the legislature and the executive &ndash; cannot interfere in the work of the judiciary. The courts are not under the government and do not act on their behalf.</p>
<p>For the above separation to work well, it is also crucial that all judges in the High Court as well as the Supreme Court are appointed with very little interference from these other branches of government. Once appointed to this office, it is also very difficult to remove a Judge. It is the independence of the judiciary that allows the courts to play a central role in ensuring that there is no misuse of power by the legislature and the executive. It also plays a crucial role in protecting the Fundamental Rights of citizens because anyone can approach the courts if they believe that their rights have been violated.</p>
<p><strong>The Structure of Courts in India</strong></p>
<p>There are three different levels of courts in our country. There are several courts at the lower level while there is only one at the apex level. The courts that most people interact with are what are called subordinate or district courts. These are usually at the district or Tehsil level or in towns and they hear many kinds of cases. Each state is divided into districts that are presided over by a District Judge. Each state has a High Court which is the highest court of that state. At the top is the Supreme Court that is located in New Delhi and is presided over by the Chief Justice of India. The decisions made by the Supreme Court are binding on all other courts in India.</p>
<p>In India, we have an integrated judicial system, meaning that the decisions made by higher courts are binding on the lower courts. Another way to understand this integration is through the appellate system that exists in India. This means that a person can appeal to a higher court if they believe that the judgement passed by the lower court is not just.</p>

  <div class="menu-content Litigation"><h1>Public Interest Litigation</h1><hr>
<p>The Public Interest Litigation has opened new gates for the litigants to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court. Now, any public spirited person or a social activist group can invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court by filling a Public Interest Petition. The filing of these petitions is now regulated by the Rules framed by the High Court. The High Court has also exercised jurisdiction on the basis of news items published in the newspapers and on the basis of the letters written by the aggrieved persons to it.</p></div>

  <div class="menu-content Legislature"><h1>STATE LEGISLATURE</h1>
<p>The Constitution provides for a Legislature for every State. However, the question as to whether the State Legislature shall be unicameral (having one House only) or bicameral (having two Houses), is left for each State to decide of itself. The Constitution does not provide for bicameral legislature for all states. It provides bicameral legislature for U.P., Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Jammu and Kashmir has bicameral legislature but under its own Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Council</strong></p>
<p>The Legislative Council, commonly known as Vidhan Parishad, is the Upper House of the State Legislature. It is constituted as a permanent House. <strong>Article 171(1)&nbsp;</strong>provides that the total number of members in the Legislative Council of a State shall not exceed one-third of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly of that State, but not less than 40 members in any case.</p>
<p><strong>Abolition or Creation of Legislative Councils</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 169&nbsp;</strong>deals with the creation or abolition of Legislative Council in a State. Article 169 holds that if the State Legislative Assembly passes a resolution by a majority of not less than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the members present &amp; voting and by the majority of total strength of the House, requesting the Parliament to create or abolish the State Legislative Council then the Parliament may be law provide for the abolition and creation of the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>The initiative must come from the State Legislative Assembly. It is not binding on the Parliament. The Parliament passes the law by a simple majority.</p>
<p><strong>Composition of the House</strong></p>
<p>The Council shall be constituted as provided in clause (3) of Article 171. Article 171(3) states that of the total number of members of the Legislative Council of a State:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As nearly, as one- third shall be elected by electorates consisting of members of municipalities, district boards and such other local authorities in the State as Parliament may be law specify;</li>
    <li>As nearly as, one-twelfth shall be elected by electorates consisting of persons residing in the State who have been for at least three years graduates of any university in the territory of India or have been for at least three years in possession of qualifications prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament as equivalent to that of a graduate of any such university;</li>
    <li>As nearly as one-twelfth shall be elected by electorates consisting of persons who have been for at least three years engaged in teaching in such educational institutions within the State, not lower in standard than that of a secondary school, as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament;</li>
    <li>As nearly as may be one-third shall be elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly of the State from amongst persons who are not members of the Assembly;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The remainder shall be nominated by the Governor in accordance with the provisions of clause (5). The members to be nominated by the Governor shall consist of person having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely: literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The member of a legislative Council are elected in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Assembly</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution says that the Governor may appoint one member from the Anglo-Indian community if it is not adequately represented in the House. Rests of members are elected directly by the people from the territorial constituencies. <strong>Article170(1)</strong> holds that the Legislative Assembly of each State shall consist of not more than five hundred, and not less than sixty, members chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the State.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Article 172(1)</strong>, every Legislative Assembly of every State, unless sooner dissolve, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the Assembly.</p>
<p>Provided that the said period may, while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, be extended by Parliament by law for the period not exceeding one year at a time and not extending in any case beyond a period of six months after the Proclamation has ceased to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Passage of Bills</strong></p>
<p>Three Types of Bills are passed in State Legislature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ordinary bill&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Money bill</li>
    <li>Financial bill</li>
</ul>
<p>The passage of money bill is similar to the procedure followed at the Centre. An ordinary bill can originate in either House. If it originates in the Upper House and is duly passed and transmitted to the Lower House and if the Lower House rejects it, then the bill comes to an end. If a financial bill or an ordinary bill, originates in the Lower House and after its passage it is transmitted to the Upper House, the Upper House has 3 options. It can pass it, it can reject it or it may not take any action for 3 MONTHS.</p>
<p>After the lapse of 3 months, the bill goes to the Lower House, if the Lower House passes the bill for the second time, it is again transmitted to the Upper House and on the expiry of one month after the bill has been received for the second time, the bill is deemed to have been passed by the State Legislature. After that it goes to the Governor for his assent.</p>
<p><strong>Assent to Bills</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 200</strong> deals with the procedures regarding the assent to the bills passed by the State legislature. It holds that, when a Bill has been passed by the &nbsp;Legislative Assembly of a State or, in the case of a State having a Legislative Council, has been passed by both Houses of the Legislature of the State, it shall be presented to the Governor and the Governor shall declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withhold assent therefrom or that he reserves the Bill for the consideration of the President:</p>
<p>Provided that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the presentation to him of the Bill for assent, return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill together with a message requesting that the House or Houses will reconsider the Bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly and if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses with or without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent, the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom.</p>
<p>Provided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve for the consideration of the President, any Bill which in the opinion of the Governor would, if it became law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger the position which that Court is by this Constitution designed to fill.</p>
<p>According to Article 201, when a Bill is reserved by a Governor for the consideration of the President, the President shall declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom:</p>
<p>Provided that, where the Bill is not a Money Bill, the President may direct the Governor to return the Bill to the House or, as the case may be, the Houses of the Legislature of the State together with such a message as is mentioned in the first proviso to Article 200 and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider it accordingly within a period of six months from the date of receipt of such message and, if it is again passed by the House or Houses with or without amendment, it shall be presented again to the President for his consideration.</p></div>
  <div class="menu-content Court"><h1>Subordinate Courts</h1><hr>
<p>In every State, besides the High Court there are number of judicial courts to administer justice. These courts function under the complete control and supervision of the High Court. A State has got exclusive legislative competence to determine the constituent organization and territorial jurisdiction of all courts subordinate to the High Court. The organization of subordinate courts throughout the country is generally uniform. There are three types of law courts in every district:</p>

  <div class="menu-content High"><h1>High Courts</h1><hr>
<p>Chapter V of Part VI of the Constitution provides for the provisions for the High Courts. Article 214 holds that there shall be a High Court for each State. The High Court stands at the head of a State&rsquo;s judicial administration. The Centre has constituted three new High Courts in the northeast &ndash; Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura &ndash; taking the total number of High Courts in the country from 21 to 24. So now there are 24 High Courts in the country, three having jurisdiction over more than one State. Among the Union Territories Delhi alone has a High Court of its own. Other six Union Territories come under the jurisdiction of different State High Courts. According to Article 216, each High Court comprises of a Chief Justice and such other judges as the President may, from time to time appoint.</p>
<p><strong>Appointment of the Judges</strong></p>
<p>The Chief Justice of a High Court is appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the State. The procedure for appointing puisne judges is the same except that the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned is also consulted.</p>
<p>According to Article 217(1) every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and, in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court and shall hold office, in the case of an additional or acting Judge, as provided in Article 224, and in any other case, until he attains the age of sixty-two years.</p>
<p><strong>Qualification of the Judges</strong></p>
<p>According to Article 217(2), a person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of a High Court unless he is a citizen of India and</p>
<ul>
    <li>has for at least ten years held a judicial office in the territory of India; or&nbsp;</li>
    <li>has for at least ten years been an advocate of a High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Provisions Regarding the Judges</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 220&nbsp;</strong>puts restriction on practice after being a permanent Judge. This article reads as, &ldquo;No person who, after the commencement of this Constitution, has held office as a permanent Judge of a High Court shall plead or act in any court or before any authority in India except the Supreme Court and the other High Courts.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>Article 222&nbsp;</strong>provides for the provisions regarding the transfer of a Judge from one High Court to another. According to Article 222(1), the President may, after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, transfer a Judge from one High Court to any other High Court.</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction of the High Court</strong></p>

    <li>Original</li>
    <li>Appellate</li>
    <li>Writ and</li>

<p>Among the many innovative provisions adopted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution (1976) a measure of far- reaching importance was the provision for the setting up of Administrative Tribunals. Part XIV-A which consists of two Articles 323A and 323B deals with these Tribunals.</p>
<p>Section(1) of Article 323A provides for the adjudication or trial by administrative tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India. The power to constitute such Tribunals is vested exclusively in Parliament.</p>
<p>Article 323B empowers Parliament or State Legislatures to set up tribunals for matters other than those covered by under Article 323A.</p></div>
