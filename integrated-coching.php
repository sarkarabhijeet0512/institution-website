    <span>Many times, aspirants in spite of having good grades,capability & passion, fail to pursue IAS coaching in their desired institutes due to financial constraints. The cost of studying in most institutes, is getting really expensive these days. As a result, students who don’t belong to well-to-do families find it difficult to meet the high costs and compromise with their dreams.<br><br>

 

                Considering this requirement, we have launched a well planned INTEGRATED UPSC+SPSC classroom Coaching program under which the each & every dedicated aspirants are provided with a chance to prepare for both UPSC & SPSC exams under the guidance of well experienced top faculties in one go.Read on & register!<br><br>

                ​

                Before opting for civil services,one should be well aware of the bitter fact that cracking UPSC & SPSC is not an easy task.In order to reach that coveted position,one has to really work hard diligently  for nearly two years.Well planned strategy,Guidance by well experienced educators & optimum time management skill are the main ladders for your dream goal.A reputed & credible coaching institute will help you to cross these ladders.<br><br>

                 

                Hay but wait,there is a huge amount of money charged by most of the academy & also some of them are really good ad makers,their counselors have been trained to talk with utter sweetness when you first approach them.They will offer you the best faculty they have to begin with and then slowly the teaching standards will come down crashing. so please make a comparison,read reviews,get feedback from a current student & do a thorough research before you invest your time (money is secondary!).<br><br>

                ​

                And on the other hand, there are some academies like EMPRESS IAS CAMPUS  ,who may like to screen you through  Scholarship tests/classroom merit tests before giving admission.When we say "we are the Best" we actually mean it. We constantly bend  over backwards to make learning an enjoyable experienced &  help the aspirants achieve their target.
