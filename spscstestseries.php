<li>Aspirants must know the latest syllabus and pattern of PSC exams they are appearing for.Though the syllabus for PSC exams might slightly differ from state to state, the subjects are generally the same, comprising basic, simple mathematics, English, regional languages, history, general knowledge, and current affairs among others.</li>

<li>Since these exams are conducted by the Public Service Commissions of each state, the candidate should be well aware of the history ,geography and good knowledge of the regional language, culture and customs of that particular state.</li>

<li>Since PCS is a civil service exam, the candidates should be ready for a tough competition and should be mentally prepared to put in a good amount of hard work.</li>

<li>Though the exam is a state exam, one must have basic knowledge of the latest happenings in the country. For that, the candidates must start following at least one national newspaper, in order to keep themselves well acquainted with the happenings in the country as well as the world.</li>

<li>The candidates should pay special attention towards enhancing their general knowledge and should be ready to learn new things.</li>

<li>Aspirants must learn to manage and utilize their precious time well in order to do well in their exams. Also, one must not postpone their study or revision sessions as it leads to piling up of work and increase the burden on them.</li>

<li>The candidates should pick the last few years' question papers and try to solve them. This will give them an idea of the pattern and make them comfortable with it.</li>

<li>To crack the exam in first attempt, candidates must start their preparation early and also have proper planning to cover the entire syllabus. They must prepare a solid plan and adhere to it.Complete the syllabus a month in advance. Use the final month for a thorough revision.</li>

<li>Candidates should keep appearing for the mock papers and should keep a check on the time because it is very important to attempt all questions in the required time.</li>

<li>It is a plus point to be guided by an experienced good Institution who can direct your efforts correctly.</li>
